heheh, nice to see you here.
i dont usually do this stuff here, but this one time im gonna make a planning page in my github.
this is basically detailing how snowballer will work in my games.
snowballer has infinite ammunition that comes from her infinite bucket of snow on her back
she uses her snow powers to float a snowball out of it and launch it forwards
this isnt a copy of subspace from phighting i swear i just realized how similar they are
when a snowball hits something it makes a little radius of damage because its like glass
when glass breaks it flies out into shards and stuff
if anyone is caught in the radius they get damaged and 1 frostbite stack
each frostbite stack makes the carrier a little slower
when someone accumulates 7(havent balance tested it yet)stacks they get frozen for 2 seconds.
a direct hit from the snowball does a little more damage
the f move is still the same blizzard zone thing where people get slowed and hurt gradually
maybe they get frostbite stacks from that too hmm
for the game right now the slowness doesnt change anything too much but is still useful
because of the radius of the snowball it can hit many robots and slow a whole wave i guess
