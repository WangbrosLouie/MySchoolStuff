everywhere that i go<br>
it's like my mind is not there<br>
all i do is just look around<br>
and stare<br>
<br>
but there's a lot going on<br>
up inside of my head<br>
and if you catch me<br>
feeling like myself and you<br>
interact with me in any way<br>
you might hear me say<br>
<br>
meow meow meow<br>
or something like that<br>
you never know<br>
i might just be a cat<br>
<br>
meow meow meow<br>
is what i say all day<br>
to all my friends<br>
who know im fe-li-dae<br>
<br>
i'm gonna meow in my mind<br>
for several hours a day<br>
speakin meowerese, yappin away<br>
<br>
it doesn't matter to whom<br>
to Kitters, my friends or you<br>
i don't even care if<br>
you're listening 'cause<br>
i don't care what you think<br>
about me and that's why i say<br>
<br>
meow meow meow<br>
and all things silly<br>
i really am<br>
a purry ki-i-tty<br>
<br>
meow meow meow<br>
i might just like myself<br>
embrace the catsiness<br>
like no one else<br>
<br>
i purr and loaf all day<br>
i don't stand my ground<br>
cause why would i stand<br>
when i could just sit around<br>
<br>
i dont have a tail<br>
but i feel it anyway<br>
and if you could see it<br>
back and forth it would sway

Wrapped up all in my fur<br>

Sitting on a chair<br>
in school in the AM<br>
Hiding away my cat<br>
siness<br>
Hiding away from my<br>
life that's such a mess<br>
<br>
Woah-oh<br>
Woah Woah-oh<br>

And I want to be with you<br>
You'll be good for this tom fool<br>
Why does she have to be fake<br>
I swear someday you I will make

"Meow Meow" is what I say<br>

Everybody's lookin at me,<br>

Tail-waggin at all of you<br>
only stoppin when it's sore<br>
I, am, a cat (how I wish I were a cat)<br>
It's, not, an act (don't say that or I'll get mad)<br>
Please do not ask (about why I am like that)<br>
If you say a bad thing about it my paws are<br>
gonna meet your face and go bap, bap, bap<br>

Hey hey<br>
Hiding away<br>
my catsy little face<br>
So, so afraid<br>
of letting loose to play<br>

In your eyes<br>
I would be a freak<br>
So in real life<br>
I'll never be free<br>
<br>
And if you ever face the truth<br>
oh oh<br>
My life will never seem so smooth<br>
oh oh<br>
The devil's waiting there for me<br>

oh oh<br>

i'm a silly cat<br>
and i think you know that<br>
you clearly see my black-furred tail<br>
i wake up everyday<br>
and always get dismayed<br>
cause i know that i'll always fail<br>
<br>
my catsiness cannot<br>
shield me from the thought<br>
that i am never good enough<br>
but that's just what i think<br>
i might be on the brink<br>
of pissin everybody off<br>
<br>
oh my furry fur<br>
my mind, it really hurts<br>
i wish i didn't think this much<br>
but my imagined friend<br>
won't be existing then<br>
and I'm comforted by her touch<br>
<br>
everybody else<br>
thinks i'm on the top shelf<br>
but i'm really too short to reach<br>
they say "wow you're so smart"<br>
and "you have a big heart"<br>
the truth is what they're tryna preach<br>
<br>
but i ignore it all<br>
and go into freefall<br>
into the worst that i can be<br>
cause it just seems so fake<br>
a super big mistake<br>
that they believe in li'l ol' me<br>
<br>
oh my furry fur<br>
my mind, it really hurts<br>
i wanna be lobotomized<br>
cause then, after it's done<br>
i'll actually be dumb<br>
exactly the way i surmised<br>
<br>
i know deep down that<br>
i have a big brain<br>
but i wanna<br>
be free of this pain<br>
of my expectations<br>
goin' all ham<br>
and if i fail then<br>
-then that's all i am<br>

My catsiness is overwhelming<br>
Everyday I want to meow, (meow!)<br>

But I'm always way too scared to do that<br>
so I can't do anything but hide!<br>

Look, I got paws, and<br>
lookit my face, got some<br>
whiskers and a snout and I<br>
must sound crazed, but I<br>
do prefer being a feline, or at<br>
least some thing that's catsier than<br>
this prison of mine<br>

How is your day<br>
Are you doing fine now<br>
Aversion to my own kin<br>
despite the feeling deep<br>
in my brain telling me<br>
I want them and they<br>
want me as well<br>
But there's this thing<br>
That no one knows about me<br>
And that's that I'm a kitty<br>
and I wanna be pet<br>
a stroke on my back<br>
a brush on my head<br>
But nobody wants to<br>
give the cat a pet<br>
They see me as a man<br>
even through all my fur<br>
I don't wanna use this<br>
stupid body no more<br>
a rub on my ears<br>
a scratch on my chin<br>
someone please appease<br>
my catsiness within<br>
I just wanna be a cute<br>
little four legged creature<br>
