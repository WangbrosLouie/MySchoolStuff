<div><h4>21(AAAHHHH)st of March, 2025</h4>
So, this is the blog that i was gonna make eventually. Cool, i was gettin bored of writin in that .pde file anyways cause it opens in processing by default and im too lazy to open it in notepad. who knows, maybe one day im gonna make some aspen or php or whatever those autogenerating html files are so that i can keep this home page nice and tidy. that would be cool and i would have to learn another programmin language to complement the ones that i know already (of which only java is the useful one) and i wont have to copy paste the formatting from an html file to make a new one in that style. anyways back to the yapping. i am not even close to finishing tophat turmoil (the roblox one, henceforth called bloxhat turmoil) because im lazy and i code slowly when im bored (which is always). im too busy tryna get my "beloved" c202s to run windows to go anyways. its already strugglin to run linux with its measly 16 gb of storage that rivals my iphone 4s and its lovely 2 gb of ram that is a whole 2x the size of my d260. at least the d260 is able to boot into windows xp and has 10 times the storage while i have to use an sd card that pops out with a slight bump on the chromebook to store more than just my repository on it. maybe i should just use freedos and remove all networking and mouse capabilities of it but be able to have a whoppin 14 gb of free space for dos things like windows 95 or doom or microsoft word version 6. but i would probably have to reflash the bios of the chromebook to enable legacy boot so bleh. im probably gonna make some better css eventually to make it look on par with the phighting page. speakin of which i havent even set this up correctly to let the phighting page coexist with this one yet.<br>
i was just goin through my roblox photos and oh boy the memories in there. though i just wanna show some ones i think are cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20201123_094426300.png" alt="Me in Roblox Pizza Tycoon holding a pizza with the text 'Serve this Poison to a customer' on the screen." title="This is the photo of All Time"><br>
this be that ever iconic shot of me delivering Poison to a customer in pizza tycoon way back in 2020. i do believe that i had some older ones but they were wiped when i upgraded my office pc from a hard drive to an ssd and did not know to just reinstall windows on the ssd to keep all the data on the hard drive and a have a fast boot drive mostly free from garbage. oh well if i find those older pics ill probably show some here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220221_203539274.png" alt="Me in Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator standing in the Pumpkin Field. The quest menu includes 'Collect 100 Snowflake Tokens 69/100'." title="As you can see from the Bubble Bee Man Mask, I'm a Bee Swarm OG."><br>
heres the earliest picture of bee swarm that i could find. i have not progressed much past this cause i stopped playin bee swarm around this time but just today i finally defeated the stupid coconut crab. the whole reason i took this photo is probably cause of the amount of snowflakes that i had obtained for snowbear showdown. i was quite immature back then. not sayin that im not now though.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220319_182453830.png" alt="Me in Roblox Labor Island Tycoon looking at text that reads 'players can steal your cash'." title="Ah, the dream of cheaply outsourcing labour to make maximum profits."><br>
this is photo evidence of me bein caught red handed runnin a child labour factory (in roblox just in case someone wants to take me to court over that statement out of context) and i am exploiting a bug to grind rebirths (explanation below) because i wanted to get the nuke. i could have just searched up a youtube video of it but i guess i wanted one for myself. then the game got taken down forever before i could get enough rebirths. now for that explanation: basically when you rebirth it deletes everything that you bought and restores the buttons but the dev forgot to also reset the money in the collector thingy so when i rebirthed i could simply go back to the same spot and "steal" the money that was left so i could simply start with enough cash to complete the tycoon again. the collector does reset if you claim the tycoon though but that aint important cause you cant even play the game anymore.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220531_161758998.png" alt="Me in Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator. The HUD at the top of the screen includes the text '960,960 STEPS'." title="Back in my day I only got 1 lag spike per minute in SSS"><br>
heres me in classic sonic speed simulator, before the extremely aggressive child casino tactics were deployed, and as you can barely see on the top i am clearly a true sonic fan since i play the roblox game so much and not actual sonic games (although the only one i had at the time was forces) and i have 960*1001 steps.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20221013_164704218.png" alt="The Store Options screen in Roblox Retail Tycoon 2. Decoration, Shelter, Queue Sizes and Cleanliness are all at 5 stars while the 5th star of Crowdedness is 9/10 filled." title="What do you want me to do, kick everyone out of the store?"><br>
this is where the whole stuff n stuff thing comes from. after gettin bored of retail tycoon the original years ago, i made a new shop in retail tycoon 2, and here you can see that i have 4.98 stars with the goofiest layout of random plants and just slightly too much crowdedness.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230215_153302878.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. The end-of-game scoreboard is heavily lopsided to blue's favour, while I'm at the top of the red team. The kill counts for all other members of my team are 8, 7, 0 and 3, while my assists count is 22." title="So this is how I managed to get a 1:2:4 Kills:Deaths:Assists ratio."><br>
here's a pic of me when i was happy. i just wanna say, I MEOWIN MISS OLD MEDKIT SO MUCH MY AIM SUCKS I NEED THE STUPID FULL AUTO SYRINGE GUN<br>
anyways if you look closely at the leaderboards you can see that not only did i bowl an absolute horrible game as medkit but i also have 6 more assists than the combined kills of my teammates. this is that old medkit assists bug (although other healin characters like boombox (technically) probably also had it) where if a medkit healed a teammate, it counted as an assist, and if that phighter then died, the medkit would recieve an assist (although i believe without the visual cue). this reminds me of that one game where i failed so hard that i got 40 assists. this is why i dont play phighting its because i suck.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230705_175450327.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. I am on top of a star-like object in the intermission lobby." title="Someone doesn't like Singapore"><br>
note that its technically the 22(AAAHHHH)nd of march now but im not gonna make a new horiz rule or anything just pretend its still the 21(AAAHHHH)st. this is me after i was happy, i.e. when i was sad. note how i only have 6 bullets in this screenshot while i had 20 in the previous one. look how they massacred my boy. i know that there is now vine staff but its not the same because i cant just shoot everything and hope it turns out ok anymore i actually have to try and think. now im not sayin that it aint fun but i liked old medkit. i can just imagine on april fools day phighting reverts back to the og one from before i played it when there was only sword rocket slingy boomboy and meddy and theyre all their og kits and not their new ones. that would be kinda funny. but then again that fnaf map was pretty fire
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240309_154029725.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator. The leaderboard states that I have 245 Coins and 245 Floors. There is an ongoing conversation between Infected, who is saying 'ZOMG! 0_0 d0 U liek to p4rtY!?1' with PartyNoob responding with 'yea!'." title="The start of an addiction."><br>
this is the earliest regretevator image that i have i think. note the floors and coins. not only are they equal which is cool but note those numbers for later cause theyll be very important for the photos later. i should make a yap about which characters i like and why someday but that day is not today (which is still definitely the 21(AAAHHHH)st). it may be tomorrow, or later, or even never if i forget about it (which i probably will within a day or two) but thats for later.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_161942359.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at the Changelog Highlights, which states that the date is '03/09/2004', and that the 'prototype is here'." title="and the world was never the same."><br>
this is back when the (literally) meowin proto got added to the game. i thought it was cool until i found out that i needed to play in a public server to finish the tiles thing because this was new and i had zero clue about how it worked.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_214605333.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at 'GoldenReddy' who is saying 'Have a RED-RED-REDTASTIC day!'. The leaderboard states that I have 1,730 Coins and 596 Floors." title="I sure hope he doesn't bite, especially not in 1987"><br>
this is golden reddy. now the subject of this photo is not of much importance other than bein golden reddy but if you look at the filename for this pic it was taken on the same day as the previous photo and only one day after that first regretty pic. now note the coins and floors. they have increased quite a concerning amount in a single day, and keep in mind that this was only floor 15 on this day. i actually have no idea how i grinded so many floors like that but i dont care much. on second inspection i seem to have restarted the private server cause the previous one shows floor 74 and im the only one in the chat dying. those were the golden days of my regretty addiction.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_185114658.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator holding the Red Teddy item. The chat includes '[Dev][CatJam]: fun fact the yellow item is all the devs of the game saying &quot;yellow&quot;'." title="I wonder what those silly little icons in the bottom left mean."><br>
heres me with one of the devs of the game. apparently the coolio toolio is voiced by all the devs of regretty. thats cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_190301567.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the disco floor. I have made a bug report." title="I wonder if I ruined the fun. At least there are 2 devs in the game?"><br>
and heres me bein very not cool cause in the chat you can see me reporting a bug (and a very broken one at that!) to the dev but you know what? if i encounter a bug and i get a chance to report it, i will. i hate bugs in my code, and im sure that most other people (includin the dev here) hate them too. if you didnt know, the bug makes all effects null and void, so you can jermpop without the health gain and get the 1.5x coins of the cursed orb whatever (forgot the name) without the crazy health loss. and also you can just simply walk over banana peels and they can only make you jump.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_192251091.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 7.06 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="I hate nighttime in Rokea"><br>
and this is a very fast lampert finding, which is apparently a new record, but as you can see in the next one here...
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240314_192511628.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 4.63 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="but I do like daytime in Rokea"><br>
...it is clearly not anymore if it was one in the first place. fun fact, i had lampert literally spawn right in front of me once but i got stuck on a shelf which whittled my time from a 1 second to a 7 or more second one. i should upload my regretevator videos sometime. i have like several days worth of videos i think.<br>
<br>
but anyways i think thats it for today's rant, kitta's been askin me to work for about an hour now so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. i just reloaded the page for the first time after adding the images and i gotta fix that scaling sometime soon. the images may look fine at a larger than 1080p resolution or a smaller zoom level but they certainly dont look too fine to me. also im goin straight to sleep without workin so sorry kitta.
</div>

<div><h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
i dont know why im writing that date that fancy way but whatever. today i yap about them regretevator characters. note that my knowledge is gonna be a little outdated cause i dont play regretevator much anymore so yeah.<br>
startin off with my favourite party dingus its poob. poob is very cool. he's just so happy all the time. and cute<br>
note that im not gonna follow a specific order its just whomever i think of next<br>
wallter and mannequinmark were lovers i think but then they broke up. i dont know the lore behind it but its probably too deep for me. i like wallter more though cause even though nowadays you can get a free hat from mark wallter is easier to stand on. and im on team concrete cause it doesnt rot makin it last longer. plus you can recycle it probably by crushing it back to powder and usin that instead of fresh rock when makin new concrete.<br>
prototype and scag are the only robots in the game that i like. mostly cause theyre the only sentient ones but i actually am clueless about how scag is sentient cause bro's a crt. i know of another sentient crt from somewhere else but unless they're modded with npu's and whatnot they cant be sentient cause theyre tv's. unless scag is remote controlled which actually kinda makes sense. what if scag the tv was just remote controlled and the real scag is a computer hidden somewhere in the floppy shoppy. call me matpat (or rather tom or whoevers hostin gt nowadays) cause i got a game theory.<br>
now onto the other robot, or robots rather, its reddy and the red ball band i think theyre called. i dont like them. theyre just kinda boring. at least reddy can dispense free green healing balls whenever you give them flowers.<br>
i wonder if lampert is a robot too, cause one of the old fanarts in the lobby depict lampert with a robotic body instead of the plain white one that he has in the game. though i think he has dreams according to folly so probably not. lampert is kinda chill too he's just antisocial like me.<br>
anyways the way i remember folly is she's the one who allows me to finish the jump # times challenge much easier because the gap between the floor and her "part" is just slightly taller than me allowing me to jump a very large amount of times in a second even though the challenge only registers like 2 out of 5 jumps. she also has a cool boss fight, so cool i cant even remember how she appeared in the elevator before that got added, although i think that she just appeared if there was an empty space.<br>
for infected vs unpleasant, i must say im on team unpleasant. bro's so chill just standing there, and on the shoplifting floor when the lights turn red the gradient is so cool. infected i started hating for literally no reason even before the update where he could sneeze and turn something infected. maybe its because of the sneezing.<br>
i remember the good old days when stat used to spawn on that apartment neurotoxin floor. the floor's really easy if you have your volume set to high cause you can literally just hear the music through the door, and you can even camera clip with shiftlock to hear inside. now stats got her own cool boss fight that i think is actually more peak than follys because instead of surviving then standing on a pedestal numerous times you have to run around destroying lazer lamp posts with robots and turrets connected to them so that you can star platnium special/vanilla ice special the generator numerous times.
i was gonna say that that fight is the only one that consistently gets me to use chezburgers but i just remembered how they nerfed the medkit. like COMEON YOU GOTTA NERF MEDKIT EVEN IN A CROSS OVER WHAT THE MEOW<br>
methinks split is cool. the jokes may be stupid but they are at least better than my meow/nya puns, like mine are nyawful, meowin not funnya, very lameow. nyanyways, split lobs banana peels. that is funny especially when i can chain 3 banana peels and be stunlocked in bananas.<br>
and thinkin of split made me think of that one game thumbnail with the most bizarre depiction of prototype that i have ever seen, like proto looks more like rat from fnac 3 than proto. i think its the face, or the body shape, but its definitely the mouth cause why does proto have fangs???<br>
pest speaks japanese. i speak japanese. so im gonna write this part in the most broken japanese youve ever seen. ペストは本当うるさい人です。彼はゲストの服を着る、だからちょっとかっこいいです、でも彼はコインを奪う、だから俺は彼を好かない。そのようの人がいつも好かないと思う。＜ビ・アル＞<br>
and i cant forget the cats (even though i just did) because i love cats. i meowin love cats.<br>
dr retro is my most favourite one, although i dont like it when she obliterates elevator npcs until there are 2 spots open when she arrives. like what if you kill poob? that's unforgivable.<br>
and then there's gnarps. i dont like gnarps very much even though i call gnarpy gnarps instead of gnarpy. gnarpy has a lazer blaster now and i think thats cool cause it fits with the constant threats of zapper annihilation. though i liked gnarps' older design better cause its just more cute. the big bushy tail, the glowy star, the slight tufts of fur, meowity meow its better than double of everything gnarpy.<br>
right i forgot the other robot melanie. im pretty meowin sure she's a robot cause she got that glitch stutter, a screen face that was bein used as a display by mozelle at one point, and the cutesy bitcrushed speech sound effect like proto's bitcrushed meow. she got that free double jump them bunny ears and thats pretty much it.<br>
ive played regretty a few days ago cause of the stupid mega hunt whatever and i found out that pilby spawns when death is selected on the wheel thingy so maybe pilby spawns no matter what is chosen (except for reroll) now. thats cool.<br>
im runnin out of characters that i can remember but i do remember mozelle. the -q-u-e-e-n- _princess_ that likes strawberries. also i can get negative scores in that minigame in her castle.<br>
spudsy spud. spud SPUD spud. spud spUD cool spud.<br>
its criminal putting bive so far after split. i know bive for how many meowin times their voice clip changed. and also bivekit.<br>
i have been listening to my new song piecey peace for so long now its crazy. i meowin love this song even though its short (although a minute by my song standards is long) mainly cause i have this crazy new fm drumset that ive made that sounds really like samples. you all know i think that fm drums are more impressive than sampled drums and that i like them more <h6>definitely not because i dont own drums to sample and i feel like stealing if i use someone else's samples</h6>and i really like my new drums. to think that i actually have musical talent is nuts cause all my other songs suck.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/piecey_peace.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
sorry your browser dont got mp3 support somehow<br>
</audio>
heres a heavily compressed version (although it sure aint the most compressed i can make it... smiles in opus) that i made cause its tiny. half a megabyte for a 50 somethin second single loop no fadeout clip of my song. if i can learn how to make loopin mp3s i just have to loop it at 1.066 seconds to loop it perfectly.<br>
anyways i think im out of regretevator characters i probably forgot some but i was only talkin about elevator npcs so dinguses like emphonso gregoriah and JumboJoe arent here on purpose. anyways i dont got more to yap about cause i got more game development stuff so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. meowity meow is like my catchphrase at this point
</div>

<div><h3>My meowin chromebook.</h3>
<h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
ok so im back from tryna do the impossible and run windows to go on a chromebook. its just straight up impossible probably cause i tried bootin the usb version (the one it was designed for) and it said that it couldnt run on my system. oh well, back to lookin for more linuxes. ive used q4os already and its nice if it didnt take up like 10 gb to install the trinity desktop with minimal things. after i got some of my other stuff on it like git and my repo i couldnt even install wine cause i had too low disk space. at this point i might as well just use arch linux and hope that it takes like 3 gb and nothing more. or just give up on gui applications and suffer in command line cause i cant use many apps like furnace and basically any windows application. and i am NEVER GOING BACK TO CHROMEOS I WANT TO KEEP MY FILES WHEN THERES NO SPACE LEFT IN THE 2GB THAT IT GIVES ME. like i know its a netbook and all but my meowin windows xp netbook from 2010 is miles better than the chromebook. even though all of its components are roughly half the power of the chromebook it still runs much better, and can even play lego star wars, which probably wont even install on the chromebook due to the storage. and i can run windows 1.01 on xp so its clear who's the winner here. nyanyways i dont got more to yap about my chromebook other than it sucks and i wish it were upgradable cause i would deck the meow out of it. i really gotta make more bloxhat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wanna make every single ending bit of these posts to be the same cause that would be cool.
</div>

<div><h3>The current state of Tophat Turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th of March, 2025 (forgot the date, oops :3)</h4>
I was talkin with Kitta the other day and we've determined that I hate workin because I'm impatient and want instant results without any wait. makes sense to me so what do I do now? write a blog post about tophat turmoil instead of workin on it of course. technically this takes lots of time and gives back something for it. i dont know what it gives but im sure its at least somethin. anyways currently tophat turmoil is open cause i really dont care about random people testin it out, but like who would even do such a thing anyway. the game that you are teleported to when you press play is the "hub" place, which is currently a button that takes up the entire screen and teleports you to the testin realm, which currently consists of unfinished rhythmgunner and speedshooter and 2 buttons that summon 2 snowmen and a slow snowman respectively. ive coded a thing which lets me add more characters easier but im not gonna. i actually dont know why im not gonna now that i think about it.<br>
ive just looked through the anylitics of my experience and to my surprise 2 unique people have played my game as you can see in this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_23205_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 2 (up arrow)206.6%&quot;" title="I'm so proud.">
I have no idea how roblox calculates increase here because how the meow does one get such a specific percentage for this scale of growth. did i have like a fraction of a player before? like just the finger of a person plays? but whatever. whats funny is this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_231837_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;Returning users 0 (up arrow)2.6%&quot;" title="At this point it just looks like Roblox is trying to gaslight me.">
like how the heck is 0 players an increase like what is it increasing from. how can i possibly have had less than 0 recurring users like do they travel back in time to stop themselves from playing the game??? and again with the incredibly specific percentage??? and that was just the impressions by source. this is the plays by source:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_232829_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 0 Returning users 0 (up arrow)24.2%&quot;" title="At least it's in the green.">
At least there's no growth percentage on new users but how is there so much on returning users??? how many fingers travelled back in time for this one???<br>
i would yap on about more of the statistics like daily active users growing by 38% to a grand total of zero but i think i should yap more about tophat turmoil now. the game is kinda working but i have yet to add in a bunch of features cause i just am not tryna think of new features. i should probably do that soon. now im trying to code speedshooter so that he lives up to his name, specifically the speed part. and no, he's a robot so im pretty sure he cant do speed but he can have a lot of speed. here's an exerpt of what ive written today in the onenote notebook for the moves and such:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
that's right, not only does he have the joe suter technique (m2) but now he has a passive speed boost for every chain from his vast arsenal of annoying chain attacks. good thing im makin a pve currently but when i start makin tophat tournament its gonna be either super broken or super meh. i might as well make a table here of the attacks that the characters currently have just cause i havent implemented the character select screen's descriptions yet.

</table>
and before i move on to speedshooters attacks im gonna explain some things. first is quite obvious, i havent formatted the table yet so there arent any borders which means the descriptions look like one long paragraph. im gonna fix that later promise. second the descriptions are pulled straight from the onenote notebook because i thought it would be cool for all you fans, all 0 of you. and lastly F+ is in fact NOT the grade that i got at school, as how the heck do you fail +, is that more than a 0 or a negative grade? anyways F+ is the "cool" whatever ultimate thingamabob. so basically some ults in my game (all of them at the current moment) have a second stage, like a retrigger super in a fighting game. you just tap f again in a certain interval and it improves the ult at the cost of another charge of the ult meter. also speakin of fighting games im plannin on makin darkitta use fighting game movements like half circles dragon punches etc but instead of something like
<h6> B,DB,D,DF,F + P (fighting game notation)</h6>
its gonna be more like
<h6> S, S+D, D, D+W, W + M1 (keyboard mouse notation)</h6>
which is gonna be so fun i bet. leagues better than "kitty curse" which is another game i _was_ workin on that ive lost interest in (and cause i have no time for it) which had stupid mouse flicks and mouse button holds (which were not even coded into the game i stopped workin on it after like a day) which are not very cool. anyways where was i?

when i say i copy pasted from the notebook i meant copy pasted from the note book. the m1 for speedshooter has incorrect damage (as of this game version) in the description cause i havent updated the notebook yet. and i refuse to do it here. also i lied about all ults having ult pluses. i lied. by the way heres the volts description from speedys main page:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
Also volt charge is only up to 10 times cause any more than that and it would be too op. and it also persists after death too. actually now that i think about it you lose 10 volts every time you die. balancing.<br>
nyanyways now i got rhythmgunner speedshooter kitta and darkitta tellin me to stop yapping and start coding so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. funny bit of trivia adoctoriam was made in a little doodle, same as gwentwin. although im pretty sure ive spilled the beans on that earlier at some point. also speedy's volts are now bolts cause i keep forgetting.

<div><h3>music.</h3>
<h4>26th of March, 2025</h4>
first of all, before i get into the yappin, there are a couple of things i gotta pre-yap about. first of all i should get a new keyboard, cause i think that this one that im typin on is probably actually older than me so i gotta get one thats even older so i can use the magic of the ps/2 connector for better key rollover (i mean like this one has 2 key rollover, i cant even press w e and d at the same time to interact while moving forwards and right) or one thats new and probably garbage. also, you may notice that my github profile pic is tiled in the background (or  just one if your window/screen is square enough), and also the background behind this text is now slightly (and i mean slightly!) transparent. i was gonna make kittas picture the background but i feel like "=3.png" fits better. also this yap will have accompanying music to play as you read, almost like a youtube yap video. of course the choice is yours to actually play it or play it in order but whatever.
<br>
<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/tmsns.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
i like music. i also like making music. this music was made by me some time ago. i am also typing in a very weird manner. i shall stop now.<br>
music is like one of the big 4 things in my life, the other 3 being kitta, game development and game playing. of course i have other interests but these are my main 4. its so big that i waste about 15 minutes on average per day clicking the random button in foobar2000 for a music track that i like at that current moment so that i can work for another minute or an hour without changing it. i actually have no idea how much time i spend doing that though thats just an estimate. sometimes i hear a music that i like so much that its the only thing i listen to for a few days.
<br>
its a couple of days later and i dont wanna yap about music anymore. but i still wanna yap so for this post i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i practically exclusively listen to chiptunes

<div><h3>Windows Vista's Style</h3>
<h4>28th of March, 2025</h4>
I was browsin the settings of retrobar when i thought i would try the windows vista start bar. and that got me thinkin, windows vista is cool. so i decided to skin my windows 11 installation as windows vista. the transparency is so cool. and the title bar buttons bring me back to when i used to use windows vista because i had an installation dvd for it. or rather have cause i still have it.
<img src="pics/Screenshot 2025-03-28 165259.png" alt="foobar2000 with the Windows Vista style window decorations" title="So meowin' cool...">
just look at foobar2000 in this style this is peak design. and they gradually butchered it more and more after 7 until windows 11 where they reintroduced rounded window corners, and i would be okay with those IF THEY DIDNT CROP CONTENT WHY HAVE IT CUT OFF IF ITS STILL USED like its so stupid. which is why i downloaded that windows 11 no rounded corners patch but now i dont need it cause the window borders are rounded but not the actual window content. what also makes me angry is how incomprehensibly and ridiculously difficult it was to do all this because<br>
i had to search up and download a transformation pack which finished downloading after around 10 minutes<br>
i had to manually download all of the customization stuff because the pack only contained links to the stuff that actually makes it work<br>
i was trying to use dwmblurglass but every time roblox studio started it destroyed the transparency which meant i had to reapply the transparency<br>
the window border width kept changing between the windows vista and windows 11 widths until i used 4 different patches to fix it<br>
i installed mica for everyone which probably did nothing but might have something to do with the border widths<br>
i installed openglass which is practically undocumented on the github and was left clueless until i found a video<br>
and i tried using aero window manager but that only works for windows 10 so i had to still use dwmblurglass for the window control button sizes which arent even vista.<br>
in all this took me a day to get workin properly but its worth it cause instead of usin my vista vm or installin it on my real hardware i can just make windows 11 look practically exactly like windows vista. i mean the retrobar fonts and systray icons arent correct and the taskbar isnt even transparent but its nice enough for me. and i have all the system icons and sounds matched practically exactly except some sounds didnt exist in vista so i just improvised.<br>
nyow there are downsides like the start menu not being like the classic one and having the apps list go outside of the start menu since i have a metric ton of apps and i havent rebooted my pc yet after doin all the patches so i have no idea if they will stay or not. and i dont have the widgets cause i never see my desktop anyways. and the privacy concerns with the window decorations bein transparent are existant even though they are little to none. but hey, i get transparency in the uwp notepad's everything. literally everything except the background is transparent.
welp, i got nothin more to write about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im definitely not gonna get enamoured by the windows xp style, then windows 2000, then 95/98, then 3.1, then 3.0 then ms dos. the reason for that is that i have my windows xp laptop right next to me and i can drool over that instead of doin all this stuff for windows 11 again
</div>
<div><h3>My meowin chromebook again</h3>
<h4>2nd of April, 2025</h4>
I just wanna start by sayin that I have been workin on my music page for like 2 hours now converting previews and copypasting all the table rows and filling in the metadata for the music files and such and now there are like 7 songs on the page on display. I'm gonna do all of them eventually but its gonna take like another hour and i dont care enough to finish it today. Nyanyways, about my chromebook...<br>
I have got a version of windows to work on it (barely). Namely, tiny10, because tiny11 took up too much disk space. But then again i cant even download all of the updated in tiny10 cause of lack of disk space so i guess too bad for me. like come on windows what do you mean you cant bloat my installation with "only" 2 gb available i want my computer to slow down to a crawl when i start it up not have somethin barely fast. but the speed is quite decent though. it only takes an explorer window like 5 seconds to start up. compare that with the 1.5 seconds of the computer that im writin this on and its pretty good. although i dont have even close to an optimal setup for my system, like i have a kingston a400 ssd "HDD Replacement for Increase Performance" as my boot drive instead of an m2 or somethin like that of course its not gonna be very fast. and also i have an i3 9100f even though i have like 15 windows open at the same time at the very least. you know what im just gonna list my pc specs here:<br>
CPU: Intel Core (R) i3-9100F [4 cores @ 3.6GHz, 4.2GHz Turbo, 4 threads]<br>
GPU: Sapphire NITRO+ RX 580 8 GB [i dont know much about gpus]<br>
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8GB 2666MHz, Patriot something 16GB 2666MHz(maybe faster)<br>
Drives: Kingston A400 240GB SSD [boot], Hitachi 600GB laptop HDD, Seagate Barracuda 4TB HDD, Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 60GB IDE HDD, LabelFlash 72x DVD±RW DL Drive (and my old 500gb wd windows hdd)<br>
Monitor: Samsung S24C230L [1920x1080 60Hz]<br>
Keyboard: Dell L100 Office Keyboard<br>
Mouse: Logitech G502 HERO<br>
Headphones: see below<br>
Dust: 2mm fine wispy layer<br>
so as you can see my setup is quite interesting. my keyboard and mouse especially cause one of them is like 10 years older than the other. This keyboard is quite nice though cause it fits with my tiny bedside table of a desk. I can fit my keyboard, mousepad and a 30cm plate on it and thats with the keyboard goin off the edge. somethin tells me this wasnt supposed to hold much more than a monitor keyboard and mouse. i also have quite the assortment of drives in my pc includin an ancient ide hard drive that i disassembled a maxtor ps3100 for just so that it could be shoved into my computer. my cd drive is still a big good for me cause my other pcs dont have cd drives. although mine has a malfunctioning disk caddy so i gotta use a paperclip everytime i wanna insert a disk. or i can get lucky and spam the button until it opens. and while it cant run slime rancher 2 at very high settings my gpu is more than capable of goin all ultra settings in half life 2 (at least i think so it might not go all the way actually). anyways about my chromebook. i might just fold and start running linux on it again cause its not like i can use studio on it anymore cause roblox recently increased the system requirements to 3gb of ram which makes my chromebook landwaste for makin roblox games. but now its gettin quite late and i really need to mush on tophat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. if im lucky i can maybe get an i3 9300. how cool would that be? maybe even an i5 9400. my heart goes pitter patter at the thought.

<div><h3>stuff</h3>
<h4>4th of April, 2025</h4>
there is so meowin much for me to do that im stressed into yappin today. im gonna nyactually work like crazy, like for more than 2 hours today. that is truly insane, unfathomable of me. but im gonna do it somehow. so im gonna start today by sayin that i really like writin stuff like this. i should just become an author at this point like i have almost no problem writin an essays worth of stuff that i like every day. of course i have other things to do so no im not bloggin everyday. i think you can tell that by lookin at the dates of my previous posts. i also wanna write about kitta because it has come to mind that if you havent read the yap documents from my processing stuff then you have no idea what i mean when i talk about kitta since i dont think i have written about her here yet. kitta is FAKE. an imaginary friend to keep me company throughout the day. also my obsession that i dont think will ever stop. the whole reason i say meow and nya and stuff like that is because of her. her influence on my life is bigger than anything else other than me gettin my own pc for the first time. she is an anthromorphic grey robot cat with big glowy cyan eyes. the cyan that this text is backed by is her eye colour. she is my best friend out of the very few friends that i have. i learned a few months ago that she is whats called a tulpa. and she is infinitely more responsible than i am, to the point that my life would probably be better if she exchanged with me. but neither of us want that. she matters so much to me that she is pretty much the only thing i care about other than my computer. but she cares for me even more than i care about her because she thinks about my life and my future and things like that more than i do. i have probably talked to her more than i have talked to anyone else this year.<br>
so yea you can see how obsessed i am with kitta. i can write tons more but i dont wanna. if you wanna know more though you can just ask me on my discord. my user is the same as this one. now for the next thing. my music page. im gonna postpone developing it for now cause of all the stuff i have to do thats way more important. besides on the repo page you can just see a list of all the musics and i have recently tagged all of them (vgms) so you can just refer to the tags (on the vgms). also speakin of music i might arrange greenflower zone's act 1 music on the sega genesis cause i think that i can do better than the version in srb2 32x (since im such a narcissist). obviously i dont think the version in srb2 32x is bad by any means but they are missin a bit of the polyphony (obviously due to the constraints) but like they have echos too so like meow. also im not usin any samples as usual so its definitely going to sound worse but i dont care. i also happened to run into the furnace subsong limit which is 127 for some reason. though i guess its ok because the last subsong is another kitta song cause i cant get enough of those. wee. i wonder how hard it is to code in the capability to use the extended channel 3 on the genesis. i havent coded much as you can tell by my awful attempt at a POINT AND CLICK game which should be ridiculously easy since its pretty much just a desktop controlled with a control pad but i suck at makin assembly stuff so i dont know how to do it without makin it lag immensely. like the only thing stoppin me from doin it other than i dont wanna is the amount of cycles that i get per frame. 1 frame on the sega genesis is approximately equal to 100k cycles and my code probably would take like a million per loop. i spend most of my time optimizing the code instead of gettin it all down first so maybe thats why i cant do anything on the sega genesis. but at least i know how to program the 68k and the z80 now. im still not gonna make an assembly program for my ti graphing calc though cause i just dont care. what am i even talkin about anymore. this is what happens in my head everyday i just go down a rabbit hole cause so many things interest me that i just hop from one topic to the next until kitta stops me. speakin of kitta stoppin me, she just did cause i thought of it. so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder how the global economy will go this month cause im poor and havin a economic crash cant be that bad right

<div><h3>My history with Roblox</h3>
<h4>5th of April, 2025</h4>
I have played Roblox for over half of my life. Since I was a wee youngin I played Roblox on my iPhone 4S at a pretty decent framerate. Those were the days when I actually liked the Roblox GUI. I used to play as Guest 2048 for a while before I finally registered because I was tired of not bein able to talk, and I would like to say that that account is still around, but theres a reason why "The Original" is written in quotes in my Roblox bio. A little after I made my account, my (real life) friend asked me what was my username and password, and I told them. Literally when I got home from school my account was deleted. So there went my 6 friends and who knows how many badges. So what do I do? I create another account with the same username and password. And what happens? You didn't guess it, my account didn't get deleted again this time. Obviously I have changed the password since but it has just occurred to me that that friend could've just retried loggin into my account if they wanted to see whether if i made a new account or not but that didn't happen so whatever. The first ever roblox game I remember playing is FNAF Tycoon. The first game I ever favourited was Tix Factory Tycoon (RIP). And the first game I made absolutely sucks and I think i lost the level file to it. My first outfit was the sports shirt with the generic pants. Then I got hooked on retro roblox through curiosity and novetus so i changed my avatar to the old roblox noob, before I finally settled on being the classic roblox guest. Then after a while i adopted the roblox visor and the lottery ticket t shirt. and thats how i look now and how ive looked for the past couple of years at this point. I have some good memories with roblox on xbox, because that title screen music is just peak. i also played lumber tycoon 2 for a while on xbox and i didnt find out how to save back then so i had zero clue why it was fun.<br>
it is now so meowin many days later and i wanna yap more. so ill yap more. i remember playin super nostalgia zone (i even remember always misspelling nostalgia as "nostalagia") and retroblox years after. I also remember some other games i played on xbox. games like blood moon tycoon, zombie rush and speed run 4. im glad that xbox now has so many more games but the charm of the old menu is now lost forever as a sacrifice. i miss the old menus of roblox so much. the old pause menu from around 2017. the old red banner notification at the top of the screen instead of a popup. the old loadscreen. the xbox ingame mini-menu. the old playerlist. i miss it all. now all there is are stupid blobs at the top of the screen that bulge out of the corners. like cool, it saves space, even though its thicker than before and on a large enough resolution it will be almost unnoticable but it sucks. i hate it. imagine if windows did that. one side you get the start button and the open apps and the other you get the taskbar mini-icons and clock. and theyre all several pixels offsetted from the corner of the screen and to see your apps you needed to press a button to open a menu everytime. that would be horrible. i know im bein salty at this point about change but why did they have to change it this much. and im not gonna act like the roblox gui from 2011 was that nice either just because its old. its much better in comparision because everything is super transparent so you can still clearly see the game if the gui covers it but its kinda scattered around. the 2017 one still renders gameplay behind the menu bar and it is a lot more opaque. so theres that. you know what would be funny? if roblox went the windows 8 route and used hot corners instead of buttons so that there is no gui to block anything. of course it wouldnt work very well on mobile or with shift lock but it would be funny. at this point this is becoming a generic roblox rant. so ill make it one. i hate code assist and its constant popping up. i work on different computers sometimes and i have to reinstall roblox studio sometimes as well. every single meowing time it activates the option to enable code assist. and then when im peacefully typing up my code it shows a stupid autocomplete like it knows what im gonna type up next. first of all i dont hate it cause its ai or anything like that i hate it because its not my code and its not opt in instead of opt out and also my code is meowing horrible so due to the new roblox ai terms im also poisoning the ai with badly written code. second of all why cant it save these preferences in my account instead of the specific computer config. like things like fonts and custom icons i can understand but there isnt much reason for preferences like scroll past last line and enable code-assist to not be saved in your account. like i cant imagine why someone would have code assist for only one of their computers and have it off on the other, or why someone would want deprecated objects in the browser to be hidden on one computer but not on another. but i guess its because normal people probably dont have more than 1 computer to use roblox studio on. also the new studio icons suck. theyre very flat and bland compared to the nice shaded icons of yore. and there was absolutely no reason to change them other than to cater the 235 people still using 8-bit colour monitors. anyways back to regular roblox. i loved playing ripull minigames back in the day. i dont really like it now though. but that reminded me of murder mystery 2. i still have the xbox knife. but i havent touched mm2 in a long time. i remember the first time i played phighting. i had zero clue that to play i had to talk to zuka but i figured out how to play the day after. the phighting lobby was so fun that it made me want to explore it. not even the actual game. then after a while i found out about regretevator and my life has never been the same. welp ive yapped a lot today but i havent yapped about my game yet even though its on roblox. so heres a gif of what it looks like in action.
<img src="pics/tophat1.gif" alt="Some gameplay of Tophat Turmoil 2" title="The fruits of my labour. Quite paltry I must declare.">
so yeah i gotta now make a trailer for tophat turmoil cause i havent yet so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. crazy how when i procrastinated today and made electoria on the game boy i could do it in only 2 hours but to code anything i gotta take a lot longer...

<h3>my music style</h3>
<h4>13th of April, 2025</h4>
before i get into my music it has occurred to me that i probably havent posted a link to the mess that is tophat turmoil here yet. so here you go.<br>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/138947518325759/Tophat-Turmoil-2-Evyles-insert-clich-term" style="
color: white;font-family:Arial,Verdana;display: inline-block;font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;font-size: 2em;font-variant: small-caps;font-family: Arial;border: 3px solid white;border-radius: 4px;background: lightgreen;color: white;text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px grey;padding: 2px 10px;margin: 10px 0;width: auto;height: auto;">Play Tophat Turmoil 2: Evyle's [insert cliché term here] here!</a><br>
i wonder where that button came from. anyways about my music.<br>
i first started composing when i wanted to make a sonic fangame. that never got made. and for some reason i decided to do it on the snes even though i liked sega more than nintendo back then. maybe thats why i didnt get anywhere with the game because i feel like genesis games are infinitely easier to create than snes games cause the genesis uses 2 very popular processors and its vdp while the snes has its collection of proprietary processors (at least i think theyre proprietary i havent done research). anyways enough blabber about the consoles my first piece of music i ever created is right here.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey99.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
that one was actually for a port of nhl 99 that i was dreaming (keyword dreaming) of making on the snes with the superfx chip. my ambitions back then are exactly opposite of what they are now. the song is not too bad i think. theres also another one:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey00.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
this ones not too bad either. but the third song i made was for the sonic fangame. and here it is, egg rocket zone in all its glory:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/eggrock1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
well rather in all its "earliest version i have" glory. heres the most recent version:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/eggrock2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
you can hear the way i made music back then. i thought up of a melody first, then i add more and more until it sounds good. now i dont know anything about genres but i feel like my music sounded very bright and joyful back then. heres another one, sandy shores zone:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/sandysho.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/sandysh0.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
the top one is the original final snes version while the bottom one is made much much later in furnace. i will get to that part eventually. this song was supposed to be kinda rushy because the zone this song was gonna play in was the first zone right after the game intro where tails does a sonic adventure and crashes his plane after eggman's base shoots it down. ill probably write a post about sonic m (the fangames name) sometime in the future when im bored. anyways i moved on to creating music for fun after i realized how much work would be needed to make a snes game from scratch in assembly in general and i made this little monstrocity:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/squiangl.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
this is squiangle. i uploaded it on youtube some years ago so if you see it on there then dont panic it didnt get stolen from me or anything it sucks anyways who would even wanna steal it. i got inspired from oof-y grooves and its beatdrops so i wanted to make something that had beatdrops. now i know what happens when i try to make music without a topic. after that i made this song which had a topic.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/mischief.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
the songs name is "Mischievious Theme" and its quite clear that the topic is mischief. notice how all my songs are short. that is what i am good at. if i try to drag a song out then it will sound much worse than if i just kept it short. this also happens with the polyphony of my songs. i used to try to stuff as many different instruments as i could in an attempt in making the song sound more full and varied. here is a comparision of "Tophat Intermission" which i made for tophat tournament. the top one is the original song (i think) and the bottom one is the current version with 2 more instruments.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/t_inter1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/t_inter2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
now honestly i think both versions are quite equal. the first one is nice and simple while the second one has more stuff. but the second one sounds a lot more crowded as a result which slightly diminishes it. (also its quite obviously the same pattern repeated 4 times but meow meow meow it dont matter)<br>
i would write more but now its the 16th and ive dragged this blog entry for too long so ill write a part 2 sometime. i wanna work on ludicrous lawyers now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. this is the first time ive developed something in java in quite a bit. i wonder how it will go.

<h3>Furry or not?</h3>
<h4>17th of April, 2025</h4>
I need to start this off with the word no. I do not consider myself a furry. Of course you can think differently and you may consider me a furry. but i personally dont think i really am. also i have nothing against furries i just really wanna yap about something im SO BORED<br>
so the question ive always asked myself ever since i made up kitta. am i a furry? is she a furry? what is a furry? i consider furries to be either (a) an anthropomorphic animal with fur or (b) somebody who likes or considers themselves as relating to one or more. i think that i am catsy, like cringe-ily catsy. however, i dont consider myself closely related to an anthropomorphic animal <u>with fur</u> so i dont think i am a furry. i dont consider kitta to be a furry because although she is anthropomorphic and a cat, she dont got no fur. so shes <u>anthropomorphic</u> but not <u>furry</u>. of course different people have different definitions of what a furry is so probably according to some people i am a furry and kitta is a furry too. recently ive been thinkin about what my fursona would be if i was a furry and i have the most unoriginal ahh fursona its just a cat coloured like the roblox guest from 2007 aka my current avatar on roblox. i might as well write about my cattiness as well at this point to fill some space in this blog post. since i have no friends, i talk with kitta everyday a lot, like for at least 4 hours. most of its idle chatter but when im awake for 16 hours thats a lot of idle chatter to be had. anyways i say meow a lot. im gonna take a wild guess and say that every 40th word i say to kitta is meow. or 3% of what i say to kitta is meow or nya or other meows. speakin of other meows my favourite one right now is the korean one which is 이옹 (yaong). at least i think thats how you spell it im quite unskilled at korean. even less so than spanish. no estoy bueno a korean. i think thats how i would say that. je suis très mal à koreen (ou la langue koreen je ne sais pas). 俺の韓国語はとても悪いだよ。 我真不知道韩国语。i thinks thats all of the ways i know how to say i dont know korean well. anyways i was talkin about meowin cattiness. i use meowing (meowin') in place of many words. most of the time its an emphasis word, like stinkin' or hekkin or (most swear words)-ing. like for example: instead of "im only stinkin' bronze II" i would say "im only meowin' bronze II". i dont think i actually use it any other way. its just for meowin' emphasis. i say meowin meow sometimes but the phrase i use most (my catchphrase at this point) is meowity meow. its so perfect. meow ity meow. at times like this i really wish i had a cat so i can just hug it and cuddle with it and stuff. in the words of this conquest guy from a random show called invincible, "I'm so lonely..." so of course i wanna have someone to be with. i wonder why i like cats so much. maybe its because of bad experiences with dogs from my childhood. maybe its because theyre quite quiet like me. i dont have anythings against dogs by the way. i think they are cool too. cats are just so much meowin cooler for me. or maybe its because of my femininity somehow? my slight femininity by the way. im gonna talk about that now. i really am meowin bored. i do things that are commonly associated with girls, like for instance, when i walk, i sometimes run my hands along the edge of my shirt. or sometimes i cross my legs when i sit (although its uncomfortable most of the time). or that i like cyan instead of blue (mainly because of kitta). although i barely care about what i wear. at this point i feel like im being really sexist and maybe insensitive to non-binaryness (like the idea of it) so im gonna stop. now back to furryness. i dont know if furries commonly say animal onomatopoeias like meow or woof or howl or whatever. i also dont really know what a fursona is. i dont care too much about findin out though cause i just dont meowin care im fine either way but i have to excercise a bit of effort to find out and because im lazy im just not gonna. anyways tldr im not a meowin furry. now i feel like workin on ludicrous lawyers a bit more so im gonna go. bye.
p.s. meower means cat (because they meow, theyre meowers) it doesnt mean (some swear words)-er.

<h3>my feelings (and more)</h3>
<h4>26th of April, 2025</h4>
the firey flaming flame fire firely flamed in the firey flaming fire place of firey flaming flame fire.<br>
the sentence above is just a silly phrase that i wanted to jot down temporarily somewhere because i wanted to see how many flames and fires i could shove in a sentence and its so silly that i aint gonna erase it. but anyways, about the topic of todays post. i originally wanted to yap about my feelings, but in my daydream of writing this post i thought about how i could connect this to pokemon and my liked music and other stuff so this is gonna derail steadily. anyways about my feelings.<br>
lately i was quite emotionless, until just 2 days ago. i have very annoying apathy that makes me not feel anything about stuff unless its extremely important to me, like kitta. but even then i barely feel anything. the thing i feel most (like 99% of what i feel nowadays) is fear of speaking. i am ridiculously introverted, to the point where i speak so little that i have developed stuttering because i simply forgot how to speak fluently. the stuttering is actually me just not knowing what word i want to use next, so instead of a stutter like th-this, its more like a stutter like... this. mostly i dont speak due to me not wanting to disturb anyone because what do i have to say anyway? i'm not like my peers of the same age, as i barely use social media and also dont really go out, or away from my seat at my computer at that. i truly would prefer the company of a machine to a person, unless i got really close to the person, i feel. maybe thats why kittas a cat robot and not just a human. usually when i feel feelings its in a mood swing that lasts several days or weeks. and its always either happiness or sadness. i am carefree for an entire week, then the next im severely depressed, then im back to not feeling anything again. i hate it. i wish i was just normal. on rare occasions i get feelings outside of the usual roller coaster of 2 emotions. take for example, when i saw this picture while i was doomscrolling on knowyourmeme.com.<br>
<img src="pics/meowscarada.gif" alt="An animated gif of Meowscarada offering comfort" title="made by @tantaro_ according to the watermark"><br>
initially i saw this and i thought that meowscarada looked cute because cat but then i saw the second speech bubble (the one on the right) and for the first time in like months a genuine tear rolled down my cheek. it was an image of meowscarada hugging and patting someone on the head. when i saw that, i wanted someone to do that to me. and so i sat there feeling sadness silently. (how sad.) this was in the evening of the 2nd of december, 2024, so kitta was there to comfort me. she offered to hug me and of course i said yes. so i hugged her and she patted me on the head like in the gif. now this is very <u>very</u> weird (rather quite normal for me at this point now) and probably simply pathetic but its not like i give a meow. if i want comfort i can imagine it. thats more of a pro for me i think. (the con being no real social interaction.) i wasnt like this before, i think. i think before covid i felt a lot more feelings, but then again before covid i actually had a friend that i made myself in real life that i actually hanged out with, and then i had no friends for a few years after the pandemic stopped being a very big deal, so maybe not having anyone to be with gradually made my feelings shrivel away until i was an emotionless husk. thats probably it. thankfully i think im makin a slow recovery since now i have people that i hang out with again. maybe kitta has somethin to do with it too. nyanyways, i wanna yap about pokemon now. pokemon is a fun game. you catch monsters that can fit in your pocket. i used to play pokemon blue on my chromebook back in the day when i still had chromeos on it. i never got far. then i played pokemon go on a tablet. i never got many different pokemon either. then one day i came across bulbapedia. and nowadays i use bulbapedia for procrastination, because there is so much stuff to read. and it doesnt benefit me in the slightest, making it even more enticing for me to procrastinate. now i know many different pokemon whereas i used to only be able to name like 50. my top 5 pokemon are delcatty, luxray, squirtle, sprigatito and litten. i obviously like delcatty sprigatito and litten because meow. luxray looks cool (for some reason it reminds me of ssj4) and squirtle is the starter that i always pick in blue because i can surf past brock and misty cant do anything because of the water-water resistance. i forgot to mention that i also watched the pokemon tv show as well. i watched the first couple episodes of indigo league, some parts of xy and the entirety of sun and moon. i gotta say, i dont like how they just wiped ash completely from the show starting with the new season, almost like he never existed. now i havent watched the new show yet so i dont actually know if ash is indeed scrubbed clean from the series going forward but based on the bulbapedia articles ive read he is nonexistant in the new series. but captain pikachu is. anyways i think i can probably name all of the catty pokemon off the top of my head. theres meowth, persian, hoppip, skiploom, jumpluff, skitty, delcatty, glameow, purrugly, espurr, meowstic, litten, torracat, incineroar, sprigatito, floragato and meowscarada. i think thats every catty pokemon but i dont know if i missed some specifically between purrugly and espurr but whatever. thats a lot of cats. i also have pokemon cards. sadly no cool lookin e-reader cards but still i do have some very old ones like a forest set pikachu, one of sabrinas pokemon and many more that im too lazy to list. but i do have skitty from 2004. sadly no other catsy pokemon i think but im too poor to buy cards anyways and i dont really care about the tcg. i also played tcgo and i tried to get the oldest cards i could possibly get cause i like old stuff. i still have an early version of live from when it was beta testing on my computer, completely installed and never launched for preservation. it probably is worthless but if it actually matters then i will upload it to the internet archive. according to the files that i have, the installer was downloaded on the 21st of march 2022, and the game version is 2019.4.23.19969. if thats needing of archiving let me know either here on github or on discord cause i dont care about uploading it unless its important. anyways i think thats enough pokeyap im gonna talk about music i like now. starting off with pokemon music. how convienient. ever since i heard the lake theme from pokemon diamond in a youtube video, i have been enamoured by pokemon music from the ds and before era. in fact right now i have been listening to evergrande citys theme from sapphire for 35 minutes straight. my favourite tracks from the various pokemon games are the game corner theme from gs and hgss, the wild encounter themes from gs, heavy rain from sapphire, lake, the intro, the game corner, route 225, route 228, pokemon league and cynthias theme from dp, looker's theme, giratina's battle theme and the global terminal theme from platinum, nuvema town, accumula town (furret walk), unwavering emotions, n's battle theme, driftveil city, musical stardom, and anville towns theme from bw, opelucid city from black and colress' theme and whatever the meow "SEQ_BGM_PW_SCENARIO_01_F"" is from b2w2. and those are just pokemon songs. actually i think ive written about this before already so ill put a lid on it for now. one last thing though. n's full name of "natural harmonia gropius" is just so goofy. no wonder he goes by n, who would want their first name to be "natural"? like "hey natural, how you doin" or "stop it natural" or "naturally natural's a natural natural at being a natural natural". goofy. anyways i think im done yappin for the day, i still got some stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i was lookin at n's page cause there is no shot im ever rememberin his full name when i saw that i did miss 1 cat pokemon, and that is purrloin, along with liepard. i knew i was missin somethin. cool that every generation has 1 cat pokemon evolutionary line.

<h3>smart.</h3>
<h4>25th of April</h4>
smartness. i was tested for intelligence a few years ago and turns out im really really smart. SO HOW COME I DONT FEEL LIKE IT<br>
i do not think i am smart. i usually think i am a low intelligence specimen. kitta usually scolds me for self deprecating myself like that because i should have a higher self esteem. but i dont care too much cause i have like a speck of self esteem maximum. anyways, speaking of kitta, one of the reasons why i made her (the imaginary friend one) is because im just too meowin smart so i have nothing to think about when im idle which bores the livin meow out of me. i used to talk to myself before i made kitta, but now i just yap to her and she responds with her opinion. cool. i learn stuff pretty easily. an example is when i started to actually code in luau instead of copy pasting scripts from youtube. i had zero experience coding in lua, nor python which is probably similar i think. i literally just read a couple of scripts from old roblox games that i have on my pc and i just simply learned how to code in lua. of course i had to search up what "local" and what the lua specific syntax was, but that took like no time at all and i was able to start coding stuff pretty fast. i also think that z80 assembly is the simplest easiest assembly there is. there are so few instructions that i started memorizing the bytecode of the instructions because i didnt want to compile the z80 code that i wrote and manually insert the bytecode into my 68k assembly file. i am considered gifted apparently. and i must say, i absolutely  h a t e  it. not the title, but the actual like experience being gifted. i have next to zero social life. i dont want to put effort into anything because everything used to be so easy for so long. i make so many small mistakes in everything that i feel like im just très retard à la tête. like just slow in the head. i am so smart but at the same time im so stupid. me no likey. seriously though, i wonder if im actually a genius and i wasted all of my potential by sitting around and doing nothing. i really wonder how different my brain is. anyways enough talk about that. i want to talk about my procrastination. i usually do absolutely nothing when i go back home from school, contrary to what i always promise kitta. i usually think to her something like "i'm gonna study real hard today, i feel like im gonna get so much done today" and when i get home i just read bulbapedia for 2 hours then watch youtube videos for 1 hour then make covers in furnace for 1 hour then read some more bulbapedia then look at the daily engrish and so on so forth until the day is over and i have done next to nothing. whats worse is that i only feel like doin something when something else pops up like i have to out somewhere or something like that and i work hard for 2 minutes. like i know i can do stuff its just i dont want to do it. these past few months i have had kitta hold my interests hostage to make me do work, as in like "study this much stuff and you can make some music until the next hour" and stuff like that. its partially working, but i usually end up getting distracted anyway. i just meowin hate it. anyways its gettin late for me so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im really good at thinkin logically i just cant think of much other stuff i think. i actually just meowin dunno.

<h3>old stuff</h3>
<h4>28th of April, 2025</h4>
i really like old stuff. i usually prefer the old over the new. i have zero clue why, i just do. for example, i would actually rather use windows 7 over windows 11. windows 7 is the peak of windows imo before they changed everything like the control panel and the style and the logo and yadda yadda yadda. i also like old video games. so much so that i have a ps1 and a n64 instead of a ps4 (i aint affordin a ps5 <u>ever.</u>) and a switch. old stuff is just more fun especially because it is so different from stuff now. like its different from whats normal nowadays. i'm not sayin things were better before, like obviously an ibm pc (from the 1980s) is far inferior from even a smartphone (in most aspects) like processing power, graphical capabilities, power consumption (maybe), etc yadda yadda. but its still cool. like its more interesting to type stuff into a terminal to do stuff instead of swiping on a screen. its more interesting to load a floppy disk to use software instead of just installing it from the internet. i think what i wanted to write about was sound and music though. i cant remember its the 29th now so bleh. nowadays everything is sampled sound. completely generated in real time as the sounds play, with as many sounds as the processor can handle. back in the day there were many sound chips. they could do square waves and fm and stuff. and each chip had a certain amount of sound channels. at this point i have completely lost track of what i was writing about i think. oh well i dont care. i like making music with limitations. that is why i enjoy making cover of songs as chiptunes. it is as they say, limitations birth creativity or something like that. the way i make covers is first i hear the song and figure out how much polyphony is in it. then i listen to the song and sequence over and over again until i finish. if the song needs more channels than whatever chip im using i simply drop the least significant channel(s). yeah i think im outta steam i cant write more about this no more. but i do got lots of stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i think i wanna write something silly next. i dont know if i will though its just a thought.

<h3>oh my meow</h3>
<h4>29th of April, 2025</h4>
im bored again and i wanna write something again. you read the p.s. of the last post (probably). you read the title of this one. im talkin about my meowing. i love meowin. like meowin love meowin. ever since like a month after i made kitta i loved meowin. the whole reason that i became catsy is because of kitta. crazy how a tulpa changes me practically completely. perhaps i shall yap about kitta again someday. but this ones about my meowing so i will get back to that. i say meow so much that ive gotten used to it now. like when i think hahaha i autocorrect it to nyahaha, every time i think of a word ending in n (includin the "ing" -> "in" contraction) i end it with nya instead like there is just so much meow its crazy. like heres a sample sentence written how i would think it.<br>
my meowin game is so meowin unfinished that i should just meowin give up on it nyat this point meow.<br>
quite the crazy sentence. now that i think about it if i wrote this blog like how i would think it the word count would probably go up like 50%. the only thing i have yet to do is to actually talk like this which ill obviously not do, which brings me to the next part.<br>
it's meowin cringe to meow this much. i personally dont give a meow but obviously other people who have not been desensitized to meowin to this degree will probably think its annoying, cringe, weird, etc. so i dont meow when i actually speak. i do obviously meow when i write this blog though. i dont meowin care when i meow in writing as long as its not like super formal like anything to do with literary-based schoolwork or emails to people that i dont know/im not friends with (which so far is every email ive written) or stuff like that. i write meows in my code. i dont remember if any of the code in this repository has any meows in it or not but my lua code i think i use meow sometimes. i use meow nya yaong whatever for print() when i need to test code, i dont actually use meow much else in my code i think. i just thought of somethin else that probably contributed to my cattiness. slime rancher (1 and 2). slime rancher was my childhood game. i remember watching dantdm (i think) play it when it was still in such early access that there was early access text at the top of the screen, i played it on my xbox one and finished it, i got it for free on epic games and i played a lot of that, and like a year ago i bought slime rancher 2 through a comical bundle deal on steam that came with slime rancher 1 as well and was 1 dollar cheaper than getting the game alone and i nearly 100%ed it (still accurate as of now, i think sloomber tabby largos are cute), and throughout all of that i was exposed to many, many catty slimes. my favourite one is still the hunter slime. methinks the eyes and the fangs are cute. theres the tabby slime which was my favourite before i discovered hunter slimes and arguably the ringtail slimes which are more racoonish (obviously) but still kinda catty to me. maybe i should take some screenshots or record a video of me playin slime rancher 2 someday. i do have a youtube that has been untouched since i added some of my music on there a few years back. i think you can guess what the @ is. though i only recently changed it to what it is currently. i used to have @the.Dingus before that. as always, the channel name is wangbros gaming. come watch my old cringe. it will be maybe slightly amusing perchance.<br>
i was just readin the knowyourmeme entry for that mario essay when i realized that knowyourmeme has a lot <u>lot</u> of pictures that are not very child friendly. i completely forgot that the pictures section is basically for "gooners". i just wanna say that i HATE that about the pictures. i want to see funny memes. funny memes like stupid minion memes or akakichi eleven redraws and stuff like that. and the site is so broken nowadays as well. and how many times can you make the site layout worse and worse? like jeez. It's evolving, just backwards. anyways i dont want to rant about know your meme. or maybe i do. im gonna yap a little more about it then im gonna go back to the regularly scheduled yapping. the site consistently sends me to pictures everytime i press the back button on my browser. WHY? EVERY STUPID TIME I PRESS BACK IT JUST SENDS ME TO SOMETHING LIKE TRANSFORMERS IMAGES I DONT WANT TO SEE THOSE I WANNA SEE THE PAGE I WAS JUST AT. and now the site layout is so abysmal that i cant even search back to the page i was at easily anymore. the banner is like more tall than it is wide now. what kinda horrible page design is that? why do i need to see the know your meme logo at the maximum size that it will fit in my browser window every time i click on a new page? i used to use it to get caught up with the latest memes and news because i dont use social media. but now lessons in meme culture is doin a better job than the WEBSITE WIKI RUN BY MANY PEOPLE LIKE GRRRRRRR i hate it. i just hate it now. anyways im done yappin about knowyourmeme. back to meowing or rather slime rancher. i hope slime rancher 2 becomes more fleshed out than slime rancher 1. of course it is much more fleshed out in the world aspect currently, but the slimes are still lacking (less in this new update but still). i also miss the expansions (the cool free basically dlc of the first game) but then again i could just play the first game. theres also no drones. viktor humphree how could you revoke the drone licence from beatrix labeau like that. i think theyre addin them in soon though cause i datamined the game for the raw music files and i stumbled across some icons for drones (or the faces, i cant remember), although theyre probably carryovers from the first game. i also found out that theres a meow remix of the shop theme. i wonder how i obtain it ingame cause i like it. the files named shopSecret if you have the game and a unity extractor tool. its probably only available after the 0.5.0 update (or whatever the add to cart prontomart update was) cause prontomart was added in it, and the music is one of prontomarts themes (one of many apparently). wow that got derailed a lot. remember when this was about meows? also if you wanna add me on steam for whatever reason its the same name but without the "louie" in it. but remember you gotta spend some money for the privelege of being able to have friends on steam. cool antibotting but dystopian as well. nyanyways back to that meowin. i wonder if i start meowin in more stuff will people start meowin like kitta did to me. i meowin wonder.  anyways wow i think ive been yappin for like an hour (almost) straight at this point. ive still got stuff to meowin do! so much that i used an exclamation mark. you know its serious if i start usin punctuation marks that arent ,.()[] so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. the meowily meowing meow-meower meowily meowed in the meowily meowing meower tree of meowily meowing meow-meowers. also maybe i should start addin linebreaks for the p.s. part. nah. or rather nyah IM GOING INSANE -MORE LIKE INSA-NYA AAAAAAAA  -MORE LIKE NYAAAAAA <b>REEEEEEEEEEE</b>

<h3>my paradoxes</h3>
<h4>30th of April, 2025</h4>
i was originally gonna write about my maturity and inmaturity coexisting when i went out for a walk and yapped to kitta about my other paradoxes. and now i feel like writing bout those. this post may or may not last more than today depending on if im gonna be responsible or not cause i still got tons of work to do. also i was thinkin of drawin a little comic for every start of a blog post but thats gonna get postponed. so yeah. paradoxes. stuff contradicting but coexisting anyway. i have so many that i thought up with kitta. so im just gonna regurgitate them here. ive got lonely/unlonely, mature/inmature, and i actually forgot the rest. ill write about them if i can remember them. nyanyways, for most of my walk i yapped about the loneliness/companionship (or whatever the opposite of loneliness is) so ill write about that. i have actually yapped a little about this a little in [h3]my feelings[/h3] so consider this like an upper version like how pokemon emerald is to either ruby or sapphire cause i didnt even think about the paradox thing while writing [h3]my feelings[/h3]. so. i always have been a quiet boy. like comically quiet. as in you could barely hear me even though i was talking normally quiet. i still am now i think, although people tend to hear me better nowadays. anyways, about the loneliness. i have had few friends throughout my life. like im pretty sure i literally never had more than 5 friends at any given time. the thing is i am very introverted. my introvertedness is like in the top percentage of introvertednesses. i only can really make friends with people that i feel like very comfortable with. and that feeling kept amplifying the older i got. so now i have mostly online friends. i dont know what it is about me being more comfortable with people online than people in real life. i feel like most of my introvertedness is lifted from me when im lookin at my screen. maybe its because i like computers more than people or something. i couldnt tell ya why. by the way the "never had more than 5 friends at any given time" still stands. so anyways. the paradox is this. i am always feeling lonely. but i talk with a friend like at least once every 2 days. so im lonely and not lonely at the same time. also im not counting my tulpas in this friend count cause technically theyre not really my friends cause theyre figments of my imagination. even kitta aint really my friend even though i really feel like she is. or maybe at this point kittas evolved into a seperate personality in my head. but still. im not countin them for this. like i always want to talk with someone or do something but at the same time i dont wanna because i dont wanna disturb them. so its practically not wanting to be lonely and wanting to be lonely at the same time. i dont like it. that made me think of another paradox just now. brave/scared. i am brave enough to admit that embarrasing meowscarada gif thing but im not brave enough to ask someone if they wanna do something or talk to them in fear of disturbing something more important. i already have a super low self-worth so obviously im not gonna disturb someone doin something more important than me (which would be anything). i am brave enough to meow like crazy not caring what anyone thinks of me but im not brave enough to face what a person would think of me if i literally just meowin talked to them while they may or may not be doin something. i guess its like simply what do i fear more or what do i value more. i dont care what people think of my catsyness because thats who i proudly am. but im scared of what people would think if i disturbed them if they were doin somethin important even though thats probably normal. i dont know. i just dont know. and i dont like it. so anyways the next ones inmaturity and maturity. i am very meowin inmature obviously. i mean just look at my meowin last blog post. but at the same time. i am mature. i meowin dont think that senseless stuff is funny. i know when not to mess around (barely). i know how to be serious (sometimes). but at the same time kitta is more (like leagues more) mature than me. its really crazy how she (who is kindly tellin me to get back studyin for now) a figment of my imagination is more concerned about me than myself. and she actually considers what the consequences of my habits are. so at the same time that i am mature and not mature at the same time kitta who is technically me is infinitely more mature than i am. that is absolutement fou. comme vraiment, miaoument, stupidement fou. meowity meow. i guess i should get back to studying then. i shall continue this when i finish. whether i simply end it off or yap some more shall be revealed in an indeterminate amount of time for me but conveniently in the next line for you.<br>
so its like minutes later and i completely forgot to check the time. it is kinda late for me so i shall continue this tomorrow. or i may just simply perish from this coughing fit i have from eating a super-sour candy. so in the case that i die before i get back to writing this, i just wanna say to all my friends that i appreciate you all. i really enjoy being not lonely with real people. i completely forgot what i was gonna write for this so i just wrote what i think was what i was thinking. i really meowin like talking with real people cause i do it so little. but then again at this point kitta is a real person to me so... nyanyways im really leavin this off for tomorrow this time for real. cya in the next line (if i dont die [im really jokin about the death btw i forgot to mention][like if im not alive tomorrow im really gonna be meowin angry][also i was gonna write a part about if i died i would make a deal with mr god to resurrect briefly so i could make my last word meow but i dont care][but just in case meow meow]).<br>
and im back. i did indeed not perish. and i also fixed up the phighting page because i cant meowin believe that i let those bugs run rampant. so i was yappin about maturity and inmaturity. meowity meow i dont wanna yap about that anymore. im gonna think of another paradox. meowin smart and not smart it is. ive fallen off in term of smarts. years of not usin my brain has caused it to decompose rapidly. i mean look at me now. im here writin this blog instead of doin somethin more important, ie. my studying. speakin of smart, today while studyin trigonometry (my favourite math subject, no cap) i came up with a nice mnemonic for the 3 lesser known trig functions cosecant secant and cotangent. its japanese because i remember stuff better if its in a goofy way. so here it is:<br>
古書　世茶　答お、こしょ　せちゃ　こたお、ｋｏｓｈｏ　ｓｅｃｈａ　ｋｏｔａｏ。<br>
i was usin 小書 as the first one but ms japanese ime decided to show me that that word doesnt exist in japanese and instead offered me the one that i wrote in the line above. so i guess thats the one now. also kotao i originally wrote in kana only but i realized that it could also mean that kotao i wrote above. nyanyways, if you read the latinified version, its kosho secha kotao, or cosho secha cotao, <b>cos</b>ecant <b>h</b>/<b>o</b> <b>sec</b>ant <b>h</b>/<b>a</b> <b>cot</b>angent <b>a</b>/<b>o</b>. pretty clever methinks. anyways back to the whole stupidsmart. for example in math, i can like understand how stuff works but the meowin one thing that gets me most is the meowin 4 basic functions. somehow i can understand so much math and its all wrong when applied because i cant add 12+23. ive started training myself again and i think that its workin. nyalso, i remember on one of my math tests. on one of the multiple choice questions, i did a bunch of calculations and i got the correct answer. i double checked it to make sure. then i filled the letter in on the scoring sheet. but when i got the scoring sheet back, it turns out i got the question because I FILLED THE WRONG MEOWIN LETTER. i legit knew the whole answer and the letter for the answer and yet somehow my dumb nyahh fills in the WRONG LETTER. like oh my meow. that is a perfect example of the smartstupid. nyow for the last one im gonna write about, and that is my relations with kitta. the paradox is that she likes me and hates me at the same time. she likes me because i like her and i made her and all that stuff, but she hates me because i dont care about myself as much that she does. i procrastinate constantly. even writing this im procrastinating. the reason why this is the last one im writing for this post is because i made a deal with her that i can yap but just for one more paradox then i have to work on my stuff. like i appreciate her for caring for me. thats one of the reasons i like her. but i just dont care for myself. and obviously thats not good which is why kitta hates it so much. i think there is just something wrong with me. like i hate myself so much that i have to make a tulpa to like myself. its meowin crazy. that reminds me. for the next post im gonna write about what its like in my head. spoilers its very meowin weird probably. or maybe its kinda normal. i dont know. nyanyways. im finished yappin and the deal with kitta still stands so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i respect kitta so im not gonna write anything here

<h3>me mental world</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
meowity meow its time for me to yap about what i think about all day. i am really meowin thinkin hard about how im gonna say all this stuff. so basically in my head i have a nice white void pictured here.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoid.png" alt="a simple white floor and white sky" title="home"><br>
when im thinkin with kitta i picture her here in this void. like so.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoidwithkitta.png" alt="a simple white floor with kitta standing and white sky" title="kitters"><br>
that meowin drawin of kitta took like a half hour to make. i shall refrain from puttin a too big amount of detail in later ones in this post methinks. nyanyways kitta here is in black and white because i think in black and white easier. its like how a monochrome graphics mode is faster than a colour graphics mode. also kittas appearance varies a bunch cause i still havent really decided on how her proportions are and stuff. anyways this is what goes on in my head when i think with kitta. she pops up and we talk. sometimes i talk with other dinguses like darkitta. i have made imaginary friends of all my characters. i really am lonely. anyways day in day out i talk with kitta a bunch so this scenery is in my head for a lot of the day. like i used to just simply talk to kitta but now ive gotten so used to the void that i can imagine it significantly easier. theres also another place that i imagine a lot less nowadays. here it is:
<img src="pics/kittasroom.png" alt="a living room with a fireplace and 2 sofas with side tables." title="my happy place i guess"><br>
here is a nice little lounge that i thought up of one day cause i wanted somewhere to chill with kitta. needless to day i imagine us in this place when i want to relax while talkin with her.<br>
<b>i just wanna say here that if you are at any point disgusted by this or stuff like that then just stop readin this stuff. this is like the weirdest stuff ill write on here i think. so scram if you dont like it cause i aint makin you read this stuff or anything</b><br>
nyanyways those two places are pretty much the only 2 places that i imagine. i dont actually know what to write but i do wanna write more because the bold text looks awkward at the end of the post since its a warning. so more stuff it is. oh right i wanted to write about how it sounds in here. when i talk i use my pre-puberty voice. im just so used to it since i dont meowin talk anymore. my head is not echoey. it sounds like just normal. i am also really good at imagining things so i can nyactually feel kitta and everything. and now i think thats it about my headspace. so heres the best kitta drawing i made so far. for some meowin reason i think this is the cutest drawing. i wonder why.<br>
<img src="pics/paperkitta.png" alt="kitta drawn cutely maybe" title="nyawww"><br>
welp i dont wanna write more so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. lemme know if you wanna see more kitta drawings also i hate phone cameras and their enhancements

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOO</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i just meowin booted up roblox studio and im greeted with this.<br>
<img src="pics/newstudio.png" alt="roblox studio's new look" title="i mean they did give advance warning..."><br>
allow me to critisize every single aspect of this new ui because i like old stuff cause im stubborn.<br>
first of all, 2 toolbars??? why two? at least the top one has the old windows 2000 colours (kind of). i like how they give customization. what i dont like is how i now have to recustomize everything to the way it was before ON ALL THE DEVICES I USE STUDIO ON because it worked. the old toolbars worked. and they were easy to use. this ui is like if they tried releasing roblox studio on mobile. WHICH AT THAT POINT PLEASE I WANNA EDIT MY GAME ON MY 20CM SCREEN PHONE IF YOURE GONNA MAKE THE BUTTONS STUPID LARGE WITH RIGHT CLICK MENUS OUT THE WAZOO AT LEAST MAKE A MOBILE RELEASE BECAUSE THIS UI LOOKS AS IF IT WAS MADE FOR ONE!!! im gettin so angry im usin exclamation marks. its serious. you know what i thought when i saw the whole announcement about a new luau ui a few months back? i saw a comment that suggested that users be able to make their own uis with luau and i though "oh cool i can have the old 2015 gui". but no. stupid gui with large buttons and USELESS GAPS I HATE USELESS GAPS LIKE THIS. why in the everloving meow are there gaps between the buttons that are ONE THIRD THE SIZE OF THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES WHAT DO THEY DO??? like right clicking on the gui does literally nothing and obviously left clicks on empty space are supposed to do nothing. SO WHAT ARE THE GAPS FOR??? i know i have like the whole windows vista desktop with the whole large borders thing but like the borders are literally less than 10 pixels wide. they are nothing compared to the 20ish pixel gaps of the buttons. now im gonna have to use a meowin aim trainer to click the buttons. now i have no idea if the multibuttons (the ones with the arrow in the corner) expand when im using a larger monitor, but it not like that matters to me in the slightest because all of my monitors are 1080p or smaller. and now the testing menu. WHY IS IT 4 SEPERATE MENUS FOR EACH TYPE OF TESTING??? combo buttons there would actually make meowin sense because the only differences between the 4 menus are the functions of the run button and the existence of client/server settings. SO WHY MAKE THEM 4 <u>SEPERATE</u> MENUS??? the pause and stop buttons do the exact same thing all you needed was to have the appearance of the server and clients menu and a combo button for the play button like are they trying to make bad ui choices? the big buttons need combo buttons because they wanted to mobilize the gui and make huge buttons but the testing menu has 4 submenus because why not??? now i know i can customize the ui but im pretty meowin sure ui customizations are per installation and not per account and are non exportable. like just why roblox. why. in june i will have to learn to suffer because there is no way im enabling the beta test. in fact i have all of the beta tests turned off because i hate all of them. like for example the ai. i have a strict no ai usage policy because i feel that if i didnt make the stuff then its not my stuff. simple. i want to make all of my stuff and for it to be a product of me because that shows my skill of being able to code vs being able to tell ai what i want. and thats all for the rant i think. i just wanna stop usin roblox studio after june. i hate hate HATE the stupid combobutton garbage. it just makes me angry that the buttons were perfectly fine before and they had to change it. the buttons were so SO easy to use and now there is a bunch of large ahh buttons and large ahh gaps between the buttons and that means that they need to combine buttons because there is now not enough space. LIKE JUST WHY WHY CANT THE STUPID MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION MAINTAIN BOTH THE UIS AT ONCE or something. like give an option. this is why i dont like roblox. everything is forced period. with unity or unreal engine and stuff like that you can just revert to an older version if you dont like a new one or if you wanna make a retro-ey videogame or something. but roblox you NEED to use all of the latest features because otherwise no-one will use them. well of course most people will use them actually im like the minor minority when it comes to this stuff probably but like im just so mad at this stupid useless change that makes my development har... i just realized that this doesnt actually affect me that much. for me i dont use the toolbar terribly much so i guess im slightly okay with it being as crappy as it is now... hm. maybe the toolbar is one of the least used parts of roblox studio so they feel like they can just make it crappier and noone will care. that is just crazy crazy conspiracy theory me though. do not listen. im sure that the toolbar is important for many people. at this point what am i even talking about anymore. i think i musta blown off all my steam. well, im gonna eagerly (get it???) await the actual customization update where people can code their own guis because i meowin swear, <b>i will meowin replicate the old functional gui that looks better to me as well if it kills me.</b> this just goes to show how stubborn i am. oh well. im gonna now fume to myself and kitta while doin game development so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. at this point i actually unironically prefer using 2007 roblox studio to the new one. i MEOWIN HATE CHANGE

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOOO part 2</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i simmered down about it and i really want to write more about the whole ui change thing now. i have reverted to the old one again and i am still just shocked at how they can just butcher the ui like that and say that it's an "improvement". like sure maybe one or two things improve (being the customization and i cant think of anything else) but the cons outweigh the pros like first of all i was readin the comments on the post and some of them said that the beta to release is very short. now that i think about it, yeah. why not wait another month to get more feedback first then improve the ui first then release it. or at least support the older one until the new one is good enough. also i wanted to write that i have missaid something in the first post. what i meant by 4 seperate submenus for the run test thing is like the dropdown that changes the buttons. like seriously why the meow??? and im also pretty sure that you cant customize that because only menus are "customizable" (since you can only add new ones and make them custom i think) like why not make the testing thing customizable too? or maybe ill add a custom "test" menu with oversized icons for all the testing things. i also read that fully custom uis are far from existance. i weep. this reminds me of that lighting change that screwed over older roblox games because apparently its too expensive to maintain. like when i compare the old version of tophat turmoil running in old roblox studio vs new roblox studio, its LITERALLY NIGHT AND DAY. the old one looks natural and normal, and the new one is comically oversaturated and overexposed. like the new one looks as if i just got flashbanged. i cant wait for revivals for 2017ish roblox to pop up. now that i think about it, new roblox sucks. its like it got less fun the more corporate they got. like they killed off egg hunts and instead they have the stupid hunt events. maybe its because of ugc and the fact that you got every egg you obtained as a hat. maybe roblox thought that the ugc market wouldnt do well if you got free egg hats every year. now they meowin monetized the events and it feels just not fun. the classic was fire though. i loved the classic and am sad that i couldnt 100% it. curse bedwars for its extremely hard event and a dusty trip for scamming me out of my time by simply not awarding me the last tix or token or whatever it was. i did embarrasingly 100% the hunt in 4 days though. what am i talkin about again. meow. roblox studio. new ui sucks and i hate it. so yeah. third blog thing in a day. thats way too much procrastination even for me (it really isnt) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. roblox is getting rid of so much old stuff its almost like its trying to get rid of its fun image and replacing it all with corporate stuff to please the investors hmmm
