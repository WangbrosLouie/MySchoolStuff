<div class="skin1"><h4>21(AAAHHHH)st of March, 2025</h4>
So, this is the blog that i was gonna make eventually. Cool, i was gettin bored of writin in that .pde file anyways cause it opens in processing by default and im too lazy to open it in notepad. who knows, maybe one day im gonna make some aspen or php or whatever those autogenerating html files are so that i can keep this home page nice and tidy. that would be cool and i would have to learn another programmin language to complement the ones that i know already (of which only java is the useful one) and i wont have to copy paste the formatting from an html file to make a new one in that style. anyways back to the yapping. i am not even close to finishing tophat turmoil (the roblox one, henceforth called bloxhat turmoil) because im lazy and i code slowly when im bored (which is always). im too busy tryna get my "beloved" c202s to run windows to go anyways. its already strugglin to run linux with its measly 16 gb of storage that rivals my iphone 4s and its lovely 2 gb of ram that is a whole 2x the size of my d260. at least the d260 is able to boot into windows xp and has 10 times the storage while i have to use an sd card that pops out with a slight bump on the chromebook to store more than just my repository on it. maybe i should just use freedos and remove all networking and mouse capabilities of it but be able to have a whoppin 14 gb of free space for dos things like windows 95 or doom or microsoft word version 6. but i would probably have to reflash the bios of the chromebook to enable legacy boot so bleh. im probably gonna make some better css eventually to make it look on par with the phighting page. speakin of which i havent even set this up correctly to let the phighting page coexist with this one yet.<br>
i was just goin through my roblox photos and oh boy the memories in there. though i just wanna show some ones i think are cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20201123_094426300.png" alt="Me in Roblox Pizza Tycoon holding a pizza with the text 'Serve this Poison to a customer' on the screen." title="This is the photo of All Time"><br>
this be that ever iconic shot of me delivering Poison to a customer in pizza tycoon way back in 2020. i do believe that i had some older ones but they were wiped when i upgraded my office pc from a hard drive to an ssd and did not know to just reinstall windows on the ssd to keep all the data on the hard drive and a have a fast boot drive mostly free from garbage. oh well if i find those older pics ill probably show some here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220221_203539274.png" alt="Me in Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator standing in the Pumpkin Field. The quest menu includes 'Collect 100 Snowflake Tokens 69/100'." title="As you can see from the Bubble Bee Man Mask, I'm a Bee Swarm OG."><br>
heres the earliest picture of bee swarm that i could find. i have not progressed much past this cause i stopped playin bee swarm around this time but just today i finally defeated the stupid coconut crab. the whole reason i took this photo is probably cause of the amount of snowflakes that i had obtained for snowbear showdown. i was quite immature back then. not sayin that im not now though.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220319_182453830.png" alt="Me in Roblox Labor Island Tycoon looking at text that reads 'players can steal your cash'." title="Ah, the dream of cheaply outsourcing labour to make maximum profits."><br>
this is photo evidence of me bein caught red handed runnin a child labour factory (in roblox just in case someone wants to take me to court over that statement out of context) and i am exploiting a bug to grind rebirths (explanation below) because i wanted to get the nuke. i could have just searched up a youtube video of it but i guess i wanted one for myself. then the game got taken down forever before i could get enough rebirths. now for that explanation: basically when you rebirth it deletes everything that you bought and restores the buttons but the dev forgot to also reset the money in the collector thingy so when i rebirthed i could simply go back to the same spot and "steal" the money that was left so i could simply start with enough cash to complete the tycoon again. the collector does reset if you claim the tycoon though but that aint important cause you cant even play the game anymore.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220531_161758998.png" alt="Me in Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator. The HUD at the top of the screen includes the text '960,960 STEPS'." title="Back in my day I only got 1 lag spike per minute in SSS"><br>
heres me in classic sonic speed simulator, before the extremely aggressive child casino tactics were deployed, and as you can barely see on the top i am clearly a true sonic fan since i play the roblox game so much and not actual sonic games (although the only one i had at the time was forces) and i have 960*1001 steps.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20221013_164704218.png" alt="The Store Options screen in Roblox Retail Tycoon 2. Decoration, Shelter, Queue Sizes and Cleanliness are all at 5 stars while the 5th star of Crowdedness is 9/10 filled." title="What do you want me to do, kick everyone out of the store?"><br>
this is where the whole stuff n stuff thing comes from. after gettin bored of retail tycoon the original years ago, i made a new shop in retail tycoon 2, and here you can see that i have 4.98 stars with the goofiest layout of random plants and just slightly too much crowdedness.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230215_153302878.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. The end-of-game scoreboard is heavily lopsided to blue's favour, while I'm at the top of the red team. The kill counts for all other members of my team are 8, 7, 0 and 3, while my assists count is 22." title="So this is how I managed to get a 1:2:4 Kills:Deaths:Assists ratio."><br>
here's a pic of me when i was happy. i just wanna say, I MEOWIN MISS OLD MEDKIT SO MUCH MY AIM SUCKS I NEED THE STUPID FULL AUTO SYRINGE GUN<br>
anyways if you look closely at the leaderboards you can see that not only did i bowl an absolute horrible game as medkit but i also have 6 more assists than the combined kills of my teammates. this is that old medkit assists bug (although other healin characters like boombox (technically) probably also had it) where if a medkit healed a teammate, it counted as an assist, and if that phighter then died, the medkit would recieve an assist (although i believe without the visual cue). this reminds me of that one game where i failed so hard that i got 40 assists. this is why i dont play phighting its because i suck.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230705_175450327.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. I am on top of a star-like object in the intermission lobby." title="Someone doesn't like Singapore"><br>
note that its technically the 22(AAAHHHH)nd of march now but im not gonna make a new horiz rule or anything just pretend its still the 21(AAAHHHH)st. this is me after i was happy, i.e. when i was sad. note how i only have 6 bullets in this screenshot while i had 20 in the previous one. look how they massacred my boy. i know that there is now vine staff but its not the same because i cant just shoot everything and hope it turns out ok anymore i actually have to try and think. now im not sayin that it aint fun but i liked old medkit. i can just imagine on april fools day phighting reverts back to the og one from before i played it when there was only sword rocket slingy boomboy and meddy and theyre all their og kits and not their new ones. that would be kinda funny. but then again that fnaf map was pretty fire
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240309_154029725.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator. The leaderboard states that I have 245 Coins and 245 Floors. There is an ongoing conversation between Infected, who is saying 'ZOMG! 0_0 d0 U liek to p4rtY!?1' with PartyNoob responding with 'yea!'." title="The start of an addiction."><br>
this is the earliest regretevator image that i have i think. note the floors and coins. not only are they equal which is cool but note those numbers for later cause theyll be very important for the photos later. i should make a yap about which characters i like and why someday but that day is not today (which is still definitely the 21(AAAHHHH)st). it may be tomorrow, or later, or even never if i forget about it (which i probably will within a day or two) but thats for later.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_161942359.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at the Changelog Highlights, which states that the date is '03/09/2004', and that the 'prototype is here'." title="and the world was never the same."><br>
this is back when the (literally) meowin proto got added to the game. i thought it was cool until i found out that i needed to play in a public server to finish the tiles thing because this was new and i had zero clue about how it worked.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_214605333.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at 'GoldenReddy' who is saying 'Have a RED-RED-REDTASTIC day!'. The leaderboard states that I have 1,730 Coins and 596 Floors." title="I sure hope he doesn't bite, especially not in 1987"><br>
this is golden reddy. now the subject of this photo is not of much importance other than bein golden reddy but if you look at the filename for this pic it was taken on the same day as the previous photo and only one day after that first regretty pic. now note the coins and floors. they have increased quite a concerning amount in a single day, and keep in mind that this was only floor 15 on this day. i actually have no idea how i grinded so many floors like that but i dont care much. on second inspection i seem to have restarted the private server cause the previous one shows floor 74 and im the only one in the chat dying. those were the golden days of my regretty addiction.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_185114658.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator holding the Red Teddy item. The chat includes '[Dev][CatJam]: fun fact the yellow item is all the devs of the game saying &quot;yellow&quot;'." title="I wonder what those silly little icons in the bottom left mean."><br>
heres me with one of the devs of the game. apparently the coolio toolio is voiced by all the devs of regretty. thats cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_190301567.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the disco floor. I have made a bug report." title="I wonder if I ruined the fun. At least there are 2 devs in the game?"><br>
and heres me bein very not cool cause in the chat you can see me reporting a bug (and a very broken one at that!) to the dev but you know what? if i encounter a bug and i get a chance to report it, i will. i hate bugs in my code, and im sure that most other people (includin the dev here) hate them too. if you didnt know, the bug makes all effects null and void, so you can jermpop without the health gain and get the 1.5x coins of the cursed orb whatever (forgot the name) without the crazy health loss. and also you can just simply walk over banana peels and they can only make you jump.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_192251091.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 7.06 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="I hate nighttime in Rokea"><br>
and this is a very fast lampert finding, which is apparently a new record, but as you can see in the next one here...
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240314_192511628.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 4.63 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="but I do like daytime in Rokea"><br>
...it is clearly not anymore if it was one in the first place. fun fact, i had lampert literally spawn right in front of me once but i got stuck on a shelf which whittled my time from a 1 second to a 7 or more second one. i should upload my regretevator videos sometime. i have like several days worth of videos i think.<br>
<br>
but anyways i think thats it for today's rant, kitta's been askin me to work for about an hour now so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. i just reloaded the page for the first time after adding the images and i gotta fix that scaling sometime soon. the images may look fine at a larger than 1080p resolution or a smaller zoom level but they certainly dont look too fine to me. also im goin straight to sleep without workin so sorry kitta.
</div>

<div class="skin1"><h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
i dont know why im writing that date that fancy way but whatever. today i yap about them regretevator characters. note that my knowledge is gonna be a little outdated cause i dont play regretevator much anymore so yeah.<br>
startin off with my favourite party dingus its poob. poob is very cool. he's just so happy all the time. and cute<br>
note that im not gonna follow a specific order its just whomever i think of next<br>
wallter and mannequinmark were lovers i think but then they broke up. i dont know the lore behind it but its probably too deep for me. i like wallter more though cause even though nowadays you can get a free hat from mark wallter is easier to stand on. and im on team concrete cause it doesnt rot makin it last longer. plus you can recycle it probably by crushing it back to powder and usin that instead of fresh rock when makin new concrete.<br>
prototype and scag are the only robots in the game that i like. mostly cause theyre the only sentient ones but i actually am clueless about how scag is sentient cause bro's a crt. i know of another sentient crt from somewhere else but unless they're modded with npu's and whatnot they cant be sentient cause theyre tv's. unless scag is remote controlled which actually kinda makes sense. what if scag the tv was just remote controlled and the real scag is a computer hidden somewhere in the floppy shoppy. call me matpat (or rather tom or whoevers hostin gt nowadays) cause i got a game theory.<br>
now onto the other robot, or robots rather, its reddy and the red ball band i think theyre called. i dont like them. theyre just kinda boring. at least reddy can dispense free green healing balls whenever you give them flowers.<br>
i wonder if lampert is a robot too, cause one of the old fanarts in the lobby depict lampert with a robotic body instead of the plain white one that he has in the game. though i think he has dreams according to folly so probably not. lampert is kinda chill too he's just antisocial like me.<br>
anyways the way i remember folly is she's the one who allows me to finish the jump # times challenge much easier because the gap between the floor and her "part" is just slightly taller than me allowing me to jump a very large amount of times in a second even though the challenge only registers like 2 out of 5 jumps. she also has a cool boss fight, so cool i cant even remember how she appeared in the elevator before that got added, although i think that she just appeared if there was an empty space.<br>
for infected vs unpleasant, i must say im on team unpleasant. bro's so chill just standing there, and on the shoplifting floor when the lights turn red the gradient is so cool. infected i started hating for literally no reason even before the update where he could sneeze and turn something infected. maybe its because of the sneezing.<br>
i remember the good old days when stat used to spawn on that apartment neurotoxin floor. the floor's really easy if you have your volume set to high cause you can literally just hear the music through the door, and you can even camera clip with shiftlock to hear inside. now stats got her own cool boss fight that i think is actually more peak than follys because instead of surviving then standing on a pedestal numerous times you have to run around destroying lazer lamp posts with robots and turrets connected to them so that you can star platnium special/vanilla ice special the generator numerous times.
i was gonna say that that fight is the only one that consistently gets me to use chezburgers but i just remembered how they nerfed the medkit. like COMEON YOU GOTTA NERF MEDKIT EVEN IN A CROSS OVER WHAT THE MEOW<br>
methinks split is cool. the jokes may be stupid but they are at least better than my meow/nya puns, like mine are nyawful, meowin not funnya, very lameow. nyanyways, split lobs banana peels. that is funny especially when i can chain 3 banana peels and be stunlocked in bananas.<br>
and thinkin of split made me think of that one game thumbnail with the most bizarre depiction of prototype that i have ever seen, like proto looks more like rat from fnac 3 than proto. i think its the face, or the body shape, but its definitely the mouth cause why does proto have fangs???<br>
pest speaks japanese. i speak japanese. so im gonna write this part in the most broken japanese youve ever seen. ペストは本当うるさい人です。彼はゲストの服を着る、だからちょっとかっこいいです、でも彼はコインを奪う、だから俺は彼を好かない。そのようの人がいつも好かないと思う。＜ビ・アル＞<br>
and i cant forget the cats (even though i just did) because i love cats. i meowin love cats.<br>
dr retro is my most favourite one, although i dont like it when she obliterates elevator npcs until there are 2 spots open when she arrives. like what if you kill poob? that's unforgivable.<br>
and then there's gnarps. i dont like gnarps very much even though i call gnarpy gnarps instead of gnarpy. gnarpy has a lazer blaster now and i think thats cool cause it fits with the constant threats of zapper annihilation. though i liked gnarps' older design better cause its just more cute. the big bushy tail, the glowy star, the slight tufts of fur, meowity meow its better than double of everything gnarpy.<br>
right i forgot the other robot melanie. im pretty meowin sure she's a robot cause she got that glitch stutter, a screen face that was bein used as a display by mozelle at one point, and the cutesy bitcrushed speech sound effect like proto's bitcrushed meow. she got that free double jump them bunny ears and thats pretty much it.<br>
ive played regretty a few days ago cause of the stupid mega hunt whatever and i found out that pilby spawns when death is selected on the wheel thingy so maybe pilby spawns no matter what is chosen (except for reroll) now. thats cool.<br>
im runnin out of characters that i can remember but i do remember mozelle. the -q-u-e-e-n- _princess_ that likes strawberries. also i can get negative scores in that minigame in her castle.<br>
spudsy spud. spud SPUD spud. spud spUD cool spud.<br>
its criminal putting bive so far after split. i know bive for how many meowin times their voice clip changed. and also bivekit.<br>
i have been listening to my new song piecey peace for so long now its crazy. i meowin love this song even though its short (although a minute by my song standards is long) mainly cause i have this crazy new fm drumset that ive made that sounds really like samples. you all know i think that fm drums are more impressive than sampled drums and that i like them more <h6>definitely not because i dont own drums to sample and i feel like stealing if i use someone else's samples</h6>and i really like my new drums. to think that i actually have musical talent is nuts cause all my other songs suck.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/piecey_peace.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
sorry your browser dont got mp3 support somehow<br>
</audio>
heres a heavily compressed version (although it sure aint the most compressed i can make it... smiles in opus) that i made cause its tiny. half a megabyte for a 50 somethin second single loop no fadeout clip of my song. if i can learn how to make loopin mp3s i just have to loop it at 1.066 seconds to loop it perfectly.<br>
anyways i think im out of regretevator characters i probably forgot some but i was only talkin about elevator npcs so dinguses like emphonso gregoriah and JumboJoe arent here on purpose. anyways i dont got more to yap about cause i got more game development stuff so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. meowity meow is like my catchphrase at this point
</div>

<div class="skin1"><h3>My meowin chromebook.</h3>
<h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
ok so im back from tryna do the impossible and run windows to go on a chromebook. its just straight up impossible probably cause i tried bootin the usb version (the one it was designed for) and it said that it couldnt run on my system. oh well, back to lookin for more linuxes. ive used q4os already and its nice if it didnt take up like 10 gb to install the trinity desktop with minimal things. after i got some of my other stuff on it like git and my repo i couldnt even install wine cause i had too low disk space. at this point i might as well just use arch linux and hope that it takes like 3 gb and nothing more. or just give up on gui applications and suffer in command line cause i cant use many apps like furnace and basically any windows application. and i am NEVER GOING BACK TO CHROMEOS I WANT TO KEEP MY FILES WHEN THERES NO SPACE LEFT IN THE 2GB THAT IT GIVES ME. like i know its a netbook and all but my meowin windows xp netbook from 2010 is miles better than the chromebook. even though all of its components are roughly half the power of the chromebook it still runs much better, and can even play lego star wars, which probably wont even install on the chromebook due to the storage. and i can run windows 1.01 on xp so its clear who's the winner here. nyanyways i dont got more to yap about my chromebook other than it sucks and i wish it were upgradable cause i would deck the meow out of it. i really gotta make more bloxhat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wanna make every single ending bit of these posts to be the same cause that would be cool.
</div>

<div class="skin1"><h3>The current state of Tophat Turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th of March, 2025 (forgot the date, oops :3)</h4>
I was talkin with Kitta the other day and we've determined that I hate workin because I'm impatient and want instant results without any wait. makes sense to me so what do I do now? write a blog post about tophat turmoil instead of workin on it of course. technically this takes lots of time and gives back something for it. i dont know what it gives but im sure its at least somethin. anyways currently tophat turmoil is open cause i really dont care about random people testin it out, but like who would even do such a thing anyway. the game that you are teleported to when you press play is the "hub" place, which is currently a button that takes up the entire screen and teleports you to the testin realm, which currently consists of unfinished rhythmgunner and speedshooter and 2 buttons that summon 2 snowmen and a slow snowman respectively. ive coded a thing which lets me add more characters easier but im not gonna. i actually dont know why im not gonna now that i think about it.<br>
ive just looked through the anylitics of my experience and to my surprise 2 unique people have played my game as you can see in this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_23205_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 2 (up arrow)206.6%&quot;" title="I'm so proud.">
I have no idea how roblox calculates increase here because how the meow does one get such a specific percentage for this scale of growth. did i have like a fraction of a player before? like just the finger of a person plays? but whatever. whats funny is this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_231837_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;Returning users 0 (up arrow)2.6%&quot;" title="At this point it just looks like Roblox is trying to gaslight me.">
like how the heck is 0 players an increase like what is it increasing from. how can i possibly have had less than 0 recurring users like do they travel back in time to stop themselves from playing the game??? and again with the incredibly specific percentage??? and that was just the impressions by source. this is the plays by source:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_232829_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 0 Returning users 0 (up arrow)24.2%&quot;" title="At least it's in the green.">
At least there's no growth percentage on new users but how is there so much on returning users??? how many fingers travelled back in time for this one???<br>
i would yap on about more of the statistics like daily active users growing by 38% to a grand total of zero but i think i should yap more about tophat turmoil now. the game is kinda working but i have yet to add in a bunch of features cause i just am not tryna think of new features. i should probably do that soon. now im trying to code speedshooter so that he lives up to his name, specifically the speed part. and no, he's a robot so im pretty sure he cant do speed but he can have a lot of speed. here's an exerpt of what ive written today in the onenote notebook for the moves and such:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
that's right, not only does he have the joe suter technique (m2) but now he has a passive speed boost for every chain from his vast arsenal of annoying chain attacks. good thing im makin a pve currently but when i start makin tophat tournament its gonna be either super broken or super meh. i might as well make a table here of the attacks that the characters currently have just cause i havent implemented the character select screen's descriptions yet.
<h5>Rhythmgunner</h5>
<table>

</table>
and before i move on to speedshooters attacks im gonna explain some things. first is quite obvious, i havent formatted the table yet so there arent any borders which means the descriptions look like one long paragraph. im gonna fix that later promise. second the descriptions are pulled straight from the onenote notebook because i thought it would be cool for all you fans, all 0 of you. and lastly F+ is in fact NOT the grade that i got at school, as how the heck do you fail +, is that more than a 0 or a negative grade? anyways F+ is the "cool" whatever ultimate thingamabob. so basically some ults in my game (all of them at the current moment) have a second stage, like a retrigger super in a fighting game. you just tap f again in a certain interval and it improves the ult at the cost of another charge of the ult meter. also speakin of fighting games im plannin on makin darkitta use fighting game movements like half circles dragon punches etc but instead of something like
<h6> B,DB,D,DF,F + P (fighting game notation)</h6>
its gonna be more like
<h6> S, S+D, D, D+W, W + M1 (keyboard mouse notation)</h6>
which is gonna be so fun i bet. leagues better than "kitty curse" which is another game i _was_ workin on that ive lost interest in (and cause i have no time for it) which had stupid mouse flicks and mouse button holds (which were not even coded into the game i stopped workin on it after like a day) which are not very cool. anyways where was i?

when i say i copy pasted from the notebook i meant copy pasted from the note book. the m1 for speedshooter has incorrect damage (as of this game version) in the description cause i havent updated the notebook yet. and i refuse to do it here. also i lied about all ults having ult pluses. i lied. by the way heres the volts description from speedys main page:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
Also volt charge is only up to 10 times cause any more than that and it would be too op. and it also persists after death too. actually now that i think about it you lose 10 volts every time you die. balancing.<br>
nyanyways now i got rhythmgunner speedshooter kitta and darkitta tellin me to stop yapping and start coding so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. funny bit of trivia adoctoriam was made in a little doodle, same as gwentwin. although im pretty sure ive spilled the beans on that earlier at some point. also speedy's volts are now bolts cause i keep forgetting.

<div class="skin1"><h3>music.</h3>
<h4>26th of March, 2025</h4>
first of all, before i get into the yappin, there are a couple of things i gotta pre-yap about. first of all i should get a new keyboard, cause i think that this one that im typin on is probably actually older than me so i gotta get one thats even older so i can use the magic of the ps/2 connector for better key rollover (i mean like this one has 2 key rollover, i cant even press w e and d at the same time to interact while moving forwards and right) or one thats new and probably garbage. also, you may notice that my github profile pic is tiled in the background (or  just one if your window/screen is square enough), and also the background behind this text is now slightly (and i mean slightly!) transparent. i was gonna make kittas picture the background but i feel like "=3.png" fits better. also this yap will have accompanying music to play as you read, almost like a youtube yap video. of course the choice is yours to actually play it or play it in order but whatever.
<br>
<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/tmsns.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
i like music. i also like making music. this music was made by me some time ago. i am also typing in a very weird manner. i shall stop now.<br>
music is like one of the big 4 things in my life, the other 3 being kitta, game development and game playing. of course i have other interests but these are my main 4. its so big that i waste about 15 minutes on average per day clicking the random button in foobar2000 for a music track that i like at that current moment so that i can work for another minute or an hour without changing it. i actually have no idea how much time i spend doing that though thats just an estimate. sometimes i hear a music that i like so much that its the only thing i listen to for a few days.
<br>
its a couple of days later and i dont wanna yap about music anymore. but i still wanna yap so for this post i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i practically exclusively listen to chiptunes

<div class="skin1"><h3>Windows Vista's Style</h3>
<h4>28th of March, 2025</h4>
I was browsin the settings of retrobar when i thought i would try the windows vista start bar. and that got me thinkin, windows vista is cool. so i decided to skin my windows 11 installation as windows vista. the transparency is so cool. and the title bar buttons bring me back to when i used to use windows vista because i had an installation dvd for it. or rather have cause i still have it.
<img src="pics/Screenshot%202025-03-28%20165259.png" alt="foobar2000 with the Windows Vista style window decorations" title="So meowin' cool...">
just look at foobar2000 in this style this is peak design. and they gradually butchered it more and more after 7 until windows 11 where they reintroduced rounded window corners, and i would be okay with those IF THEY DIDNT CROP CONTENT WHY HAVE IT CUT OFF IF ITS STILL USED like its so stupid. which is why i downloaded that windows 11 no rounded corners patch but now i dont need it cause the window borders are rounded but not the actual window content. what also makes me angry is how incomprehensibly and ridiculously difficult it was to do all this because<br>
i had to search up and download a transformation pack which finished downloading after around 10 minutes<br>
i had to manually download all of the customization stuff because the pack only contained links to the stuff that actually makes it work<br>
i was trying to use dwmblurglass but every time roblox studio started it destroyed the transparency which meant i had to reapply the transparency<br>
the window border width kept changing between the windows vista and windows 11 widths until i used 4 different patches to fix it<br>
i installed mica for everyone which probably did nothing but might have something to do with the border widths<br>
i installed openglass which is practically undocumented on the github and was left clueless until i found a video<br>
and i tried using aero window manager but that only works for windows 10 so i had to still use dwmblurglass for the window control button sizes which arent even vista.<br>
in all this took me a day to get workin properly but its worth it cause instead of usin my vista vm or installin it on my real hardware i can just make windows 11 look practically exactly like windows vista. i mean the retrobar fonts and systray icons arent correct and the taskbar isnt even transparent but its nice enough for me. and i have all the system icons and sounds matched practically exactly except some sounds didnt exist in vista so i just improvised.<br>
nyow there are downsides like the start menu not being like the classic one and having the apps list go outside of the start menu since i have a metric ton of apps and i havent rebooted my pc yet after doin all the patches so i have no idea if they will stay or not. and i dont have the widgets cause i never see my desktop anyways. and the privacy concerns with the window decorations bein transparent are existant even though they are little to none. but hey, i get transparency in the uwp notepad's everything. literally everything except the background is transparent.
welp, i got nothin more to write about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im definitely not gonna get enamoured by the windows xp style, then windows 2000, then 95/98, then 3.1, then 3.0 then ms dos. the reason for that is that i have my windows xp laptop right next to me and i can drool over that instead of doin all this stuff for windows 11 again
</div>
<div class="skin1"><h3>My meowin chromebook again</h3>
<h4>2nd of April, 2025</h4>
I just wanna start by sayin that I have been workin on my music page for like 2 hours now converting previews and copypasting all the table rows and filling in the metadata for the music files and such and now there are like 7 songs on the page on display. I'm gonna do all of them eventually but its gonna take like another hour and i dont care enough to finish it today. Nyanyways, about my chromebook...<br>
I have got a version of windows to work on it (barely). Namely, tiny10, because tiny11 took up too much disk space. But then again i cant even download all of the updated in tiny10 cause of lack of disk space so i guess too bad for me. like come on windows what do you mean you cant bloat my installation with "only" 2 gb available i want my computer to slow down to a crawl when i start it up not have somethin barely fast. but the speed is quite decent though. it only takes an explorer window like 5 seconds to start up. compare that with the 1.5 seconds of the computer that im writin this on and its pretty good. although i dont have even close to an optimal setup for my system, like i have a kingston a400 ssd "HDD Replacement for Increase Performance" as my boot drive instead of an m2 or somethin like that of course its not gonna be very fast. and also i have an i3 9100f even though i have like 15 windows open at the same time at the very least. you know what im just gonna list my pc specs here:<br>
CPU: Intel Core (R) i3-9100F [4 cores @ 3.6GHz, 4.2GHz Turbo, 4 threads]<br>
GPU: Sapphire NITRO+ RX 580 8 GB [i dont know much about gpus]<br>
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8GB 2666MHz, Patriot something 16GB 2666MHz(maybe faster)<br>
Drives: Kingston A400 240GB SSD [boot], Hitachi 600GB laptop HDD, Seagate Barracuda 4TB HDD, Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 60GB IDE HDD, LabelFlash 72x DVD±RW DL Drive (and my old 500gb wd windows hdd)<br>
Monitor: Samsung S24C230L [1920x1080 60Hz]<br>
Keyboard: Dell L100 Office Keyboard<br>
Mouse: Logitech G502 HERO<br>
Headphones: see below<br>
Dust: 2mm fine wispy layer<br>
so as you can see my setup is quite interesting. my keyboard and mouse especially cause one of them is like 10 years older than the other. This keyboard is quite nice though cause it fits with my tiny bedside table of a desk. I can fit my keyboard, mousepad and a 30cm plate on it and thats with the keyboard goin off the edge. somethin tells me this wasnt supposed to hold much more than a monitor keyboard and mouse. i also have quite the assortment of drives in my pc includin an ancient ide hard drive that i disassembled a maxtor ps3100 for just so that it could be shoved into my computer. my cd drive is still a big good for me cause my other pcs dont have cd drives. although mine has a malfunctioning disk caddy so i gotta use a paperclip everytime i wanna insert a disk. or i can get lucky and spam the button until it opens. and while it cant run slime rancher 2 at very high settings my gpu is more than capable of goin all ultra settings in half life 2 (at least i think so it might not go all the way actually). anyways about my chromebook. i might just fold and start running linux on it again cause its not like i can use studio on it anymore cause roblox recently increased the system requirements to 3gb of ram which makes my chromebook landwaste for makin roblox games. but now its gettin quite late and i really need to mush on tophat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. if im lucky i can maybe get an i3 9300. how cool would that be? maybe even an i5 9400. my heart goes pitter patter at the thought.

<div class="skin1"><h3>stuff</h3>
<h4>4th of April, 2025</h4>
there is so meowin much for me to do that im stressed into yappin today. im gonna nyactually work like crazy, like for more than 2 hours today. that is truly insane, unfathomable of me. but im gonna do it somehow. so im gonna start today by sayin that i really like writin stuff like this. i should just become an author at this point like i have almost no problem writin an essays worth of stuff that i like every day. of course i have other things to do so no im not bloggin everyday. i think you can tell that by lookin at the dates of my previous posts. i also wanna write about kitta because it has come to mind that if you havent read the yap documents from my processing stuff then you have no idea what i mean when i talk about kitta since i dont think i have written about her here yet. kitta is FAKE. an imaginary friend to keep me company throughout the day. also my obsession that i dont think will ever stop. the whole reason i say meow and nya and stuff like that is because of her. her influence on my life is bigger than anything else other than me gettin my own pc for the first time. she is an anthromorphic grey robot cat with big glowy cyan eyes. the cyan that this text is backed by is her eye colour. she is my best friend out of the very few friends that i have. i learned a few months ago that she is whats called a tulpa. and she is infinitely more responsible than i am, to the point that my life would probably be better if she exchanged with me. but neither of us want that. she matters so much to me that she is pretty much the only thing i care about other than my computer. but she cares for me even more than i care about her because she thinks about my life and my future and things like that more than i do. i have probably talked to her more than i have talked to anyone else this year.<br>
so yea you can see how obsessed i am with kitta. i can write tons more but i dont wanna. if you wanna know more though you can just ask me on my discord. my user is the same as this one. now for the next thing. my music page. im gonna postpone developing it for now cause of all the stuff i have to do thats way more important. besides on the repo page you can just see a list of all the musics and i have recently tagged all of them (vgms) so you can just refer to the tags (on the vgms). also speakin of music i might arrange greenflower zone's act 1 music on the sega genesis cause i think that i can do better than the version in srb2 32x (since im such a narcissist). obviously i dont think the version in srb2 32x is bad by any means but they are missin a bit of the polyphony (obviously due to the constraints) but like they have echos too so like meow. also im not usin any samples as usual so its definitely going to sound worse but i dont care. i also happened to run into the furnace subsong limit which is 127 for some reason. though i guess its ok because the last subsong is another kitta song cause i cant get enough of those. wee. i wonder how hard it is to code in the capability to use the extended channel 3 on the genesis. i havent coded much as you can tell by my awful attempt at a POINT AND CLICK game which should be ridiculously easy since its pretty much just a desktop controlled with a control pad but i suck at makin assembly stuff so i dont know how to do it without makin it lag immensely. like the only thing stoppin me from doin it other than i dont wanna is the amount of cycles that i get per frame. 1 frame on the sega genesis is approximately equal to 100k cycles and my code probably would take like a million per loop. i spend most of my time optimizing the code instead of gettin it all down first so maybe thats why i cant do anything on the sega genesis. but at least i know how to program the 68k and the z80 now. im still not gonna make an assembly program for my ti graphing calc though cause i just dont care. what am i even talkin about anymore. this is what happens in my head everyday i just go down a rabbit hole cause so many things interest me that i just hop from one topic to the next until kitta stops me. speakin of kitta stoppin me, she just did cause i thought of it. so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder how the global economy will go this month cause im poor and havin a economic crash cant be that bad right

<div class="skin1"><h3>My history with Roblox</h3>
<h4>5th of April, 2025</h4>
I have played Roblox for over half of my life. Since I was a wee youngin I played Roblox on my iPhone 4S at a pretty decent framerate. Those were the days when I actually liked the Roblox GUI. I used to play as Guest 2048 for a while before I finally registered because I was tired of not bein able to talk, and I would like to say that that account is still around, but theres a reason why "The Original" is written in quotes in my Roblox bio. A little after I made my account, my (real life) friend asked me what was my username and password, and I told them. Literally when I got home from school my account was deleted. So there went my 6 friends and who knows how many badges. So what do I do? I create another account with the same username and password. And what happens? You didn't guess it, my account didn't get deleted again this time. Obviously I have changed the password since but it has just occurred to me that that friend could've just retried loggin into my account if they wanted to see whether if i made a new account or not but that didn't happen so whatever. The first ever roblox game I remember playing is FNAF Tycoon. The first game I ever favourited was Tix Factory Tycoon (RIP). And the first game I made absolutely sucks and I think i lost the level file to it. My first outfit was the sports shirt with the generic pants. Then I got hooked on retro roblox through curiosity and novetus so i changed my avatar to the old roblox noob, before I finally settled on being the classic roblox guest. Then after a while i adopted the roblox visor and the lottery ticket t shirt. and thats how i look now and how ive looked for the past couple of years at this point. I have some good memories with roblox on xbox, because that title screen music is just peak. i also played lumber tycoon 2 for a while on xbox and i didnt find out how to save back then so i had zero clue why it was fun.<br>
it is now so meowin many days later and i wanna yap more. so ill yap more. i remember playin super nostalgia zone (i even remember always misspelling nostalgia as "nostalagia") and retroblox years after. I also remember some other games i played on xbox. games like blood moon tycoon, zombie rush and speed run 4. im glad that xbox now has so many more games but the charm of the old menu is now lost forever as a sacrifice. i miss the old menus of roblox so much. the old pause menu from around 2017. the old red banner notification at the top of the screen instead of a popup. the old loadscreen. the xbox ingame mini-menu. the old playerlist. i miss it all. now all there is are stupid blobs at the top of the screen that bulge out of the corners. like cool, it saves space, even though its thicker than before and on a large enough resolution it will be almost unnoticable but it sucks. i hate it. imagine if windows did that. one side you get the start button and the open apps and the other you get the taskbar mini-icons and clock. and theyre all several pixels offsetted from the corner of the screen and to see your apps you needed to press a button to open a menu everytime. that would be horrible. i know im bein salty at this point about change but why did they have to change it this much. and im not gonna act like the roblox gui from 2011 was that nice either just because its old. its much better in comparision because everything is super transparent so you can still clearly see the game if the gui covers it but its kinda scattered around. the 2017 one still renders gameplay behind the menu bar and it is a lot more opaque. so theres that. you know what would be funny? if roblox went the windows 8 route and used hot corners instead of buttons so that there is no gui to block anything. of course it wouldnt work very well on mobile or with shift lock but it would be funny. at this point this is becoming a generic roblox rant. so ill make it one. i hate code assist and its constant popping up. i work on different computers sometimes and i have to reinstall roblox studio sometimes as well. every single meowing time it activates the option to enable code assist. and then when im peacefully typing up my code it shows a stupid autocomplete like it knows what im gonna type up next. first of all i dont hate it cause its ai or anything like that i hate it because its not my code and its not opt in instead of opt out and also my code is meowing horrible so due to the new roblox ai terms im also poisoning the ai with badly written code. second of all why cant it save these preferences in my account instead of the specific computer config. like things like fonts and custom icons i can understand but there isnt much reason for preferences like scroll past last line and enable code-assist to not be saved in your account. like i cant imagine why someone would have code assist for only one of their computers and have it off on the other, or why someone would want deprecated objects in the browser to be hidden on one computer but not on another. but i guess its because normal people probably dont have more than 1 computer to use roblox studio on. also the new studio icons suck. theyre very flat and bland compared to the nice shaded icons of yore. and there was absolutely no reason to change them other than to cater the 235 people still using 8-bit colour monitors. anyways back to regular roblox. i loved playing ripull minigames back in the day. i dont really like it now though. but that reminded me of murder mystery 2. i still have the xbox knife. but i havent touched mm2 in a long time. i remember the first time i played phighting. i had zero clue that to play i had to talk to zuka but i figured out how to play the day after. the phighting lobby was so fun that it made me want to explore it. not even the actual game. then after a while i found out about regretevator and my life has never been the same. welp ive yapped a lot today but i havent yapped about my game yet even though its on roblox. so heres a gif of what it looks like in action.
<img src="pics/tophat1.gif" alt="Some gameplay of Tophat Turmoil 2" title="The fruits of my labour. Quite paltry I must declare.">
so yeah i gotta now make a trailer for tophat turmoil cause i havent yet so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. crazy how when i procrastinated today and made electoria on the game boy i could do it in only 2 hours but to code anything i gotta take a lot longer...

<h3>my music style</h3>
<h4>13th of April, 2025</h4>
before i get into my music it has occurred to me that i probably havent posted a link to the mess that is tophat turmoil here yet. so here you go.<br>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/138947518325759/Tophat-Turmoil-2-Evyles-insert-clich-term" style="
color: white;font-family:Arial,Verdana;display: inline-block;font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;font-size: 2em;font-variant: small-caps;font-family: Arial;border: 3px solid white;border-radius: 4px;background: lightgreen;color: white;text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px grey;padding: 2px 10px;margin: 10px 0;width: auto;height: auto;">Play Tophat Turmoil 2: Evyle's [insert cliché term here] here!</a><br>
i wonder where that button came from. anyways about my music.<br>
i first started composing when i wanted to make a sonic fangame. that never got made. and for some reason i decided to do it on the snes even though i liked sega more than nintendo back then. maybe thats why i didnt get anywhere with the game because i feel like genesis games are infinitely easier to create than snes games cause the genesis uses 2 very popular processors and its vdp while the snes has its collection of proprietary processors (at least i think theyre proprietary i havent done research). anyways enough blabber about the consoles my first piece of music i ever created is right here.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey99.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
that one was actually for a port of nhl 99 that i was dreaming (keyword dreaming) of making on the snes with the superfx chip. my ambitions back then are exactly opposite of what they are now. the song is not too bad i think. theres also another one:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey00.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
this ones not too bad either. but the third song i made was for the sonic fangame. and here it is, egg rocket zone in all its glory:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/eggrock1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
well rather in all its "earliest version i have" glory. heres the most recent version:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/eggrock2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
you can hear the way i made music back then. i thought up of a melody first, then i add more and more until it sounds good. now i dont know anything about genres but i feel like my music sounded very bright and joyful back then. heres another one, sandy shores zone:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/sandysho.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/sandysh0.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
the top one is the original final snes version while the bottom one is made much much later in furnace. i will get to that part eventually. this song was supposed to be kinda rushy because the zone this song was gonna play in was the first zone right after the game intro where tails does a sonic adventure and crashes his plane after eggman's base shoots it down. ill probably write a post about sonic m (the fangames name) sometime in the future when im bored. anyways i moved on to creating music for fun after i realized how much work would be needed to make a snes game from scratch in assembly in general and i made this little monstrocity:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/squiangl.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
this is squiangle. i uploaded it on youtube some years ago so if you see it on there then dont panic it didnt get stolen from me or anything it sucks anyways who would even wanna steal it. i got inspired from oof-y grooves and its beatdrops so i wanted to make something that had beatdrops. now i know what happens when i try to make music without a topic. after that i made this song which had a topic.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/mischief.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
the songs name is "Mischievious Theme" and its quite clear that the topic is mischief. notice how all my songs are short. that is what i am good at. if i try to drag a song out then it will sound much worse than if i just kept it short. this also happens with the polyphony of my songs. i used to try to stuff as many different instruments as i could in an attempt in making the song sound more full and varied. here is a comparision of "Tophat Intermission" which i made for tophat tournament. the top one is the original song (i think) and the bottom one is the current version with 2 more instruments.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/t_inter1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/t_inter2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
now honestly i think both versions are quite equal. the first one is nice and simple while the second one has more stuff. but the second one sounds a lot more crowded as a result which slightly diminishes it. (also its quite obviously the same pattern repeated 4 times but meow meow meow it dont matter)<br>
i would write more but now its the 16th and ive dragged this blog entry for too long so ill write a part 2 sometime. i wanna work on ludicrous lawyers now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. this is the first time ive developed something in java in quite a bit. i wonder how it will go.

<h3>Furry or not?</h3>
<h4>17th of April, 2025</h4>
I need to start this off with the word no. I do not consider myself a furry. Of course you can think differently and you may consider me a furry. but i personally dont think i really am. also i have nothing against furries i just really wanna yap about something im SO BORED<br>
so the question ive always asked myself ever since i made up kitta. am i a furry? is she a furry? what is a furry? i consider furries to be either (a) an anthropomorphic animal with fur or (b) somebody who likes or considers themselves as relating to one or more. i think that i am catsy, like cringe-ily catsy. however, i dont consider myself closely related to an anthropomorphic animal <u>with fur</u> so i dont think i am a furry. i dont consider kitta to be a furry because although she is anthropomorphic and a cat, she dont got no fur. so shes <u>anthropomorphic</u> but not <u>furry</u>. of course different people have different definitions of what a furry is so probably according to some people i am a furry and kitta is a furry too. recently ive been thinkin about what my fursona would be if i was a furry and i have the most unoriginal ahh fursona its just a cat coloured like the roblox guest from 2007 aka my current avatar on roblox. i might as well write about my cattiness as well at this point to fill some space in this blog post. since i have no friends, i talk with kitta everyday a lot, like for at least 4 hours. most of its idle chatter but when im awake for 16 hours thats a lot of idle chatter to be had. anyways i say meow a lot. im gonna take a wild guess and say that every 40th word i say to kitta is meow. or 3% of what i say to kitta is meow or nya or other meows. speakin of other meows my favourite one right now is the korean one which is 이옹 (yaong). at least i think thats how you spell it im quite unskilled at korean. even less so than spanish. no estoy bueno a korean. i think thats how i would say that. je suis très mal à koreen (ou la langue koreen je ne sais pas). 俺の韓国語はとても悪いだよ。 我真不知道韩国语。i thinks thats all of the ways i know how to say i dont know korean well. anyways i was talkin about meowin cattiness. i use meowing (meowin') in place of many words. most of the time its an emphasis word, like stinkin' or hekkin or (most swear words)-ing. like for example: instead of "im only stinkin' bronze II" i would say "im only meowin' bronze II". i dont think i actually use it any other way. its just for meowin' emphasis. i say meowin meow sometimes but the phrase i use most (my catchphrase at this point) is meowity meow. its so perfect. meow ity meow. at times like this i really wish i had a cat so i can just hug it and cuddle with it and stuff. in the words of this conquest guy from a random show called invincible, "I'm so lonely..." so of course i wanna have someone to be with. i wonder why i like cats so much. maybe its because of bad experiences with dogs from my childhood. maybe its because theyre quite quiet like me. i dont have anythings against dogs by the way. i think they are cool too. cats are just so much meowin cooler for me. or maybe its because of my femininity somehow? my slight femininity by the way. im gonna talk about that now. i really am meowin bored. i do things that are commonly associated with girls, like for instance, when i walk, i sometimes run my hands along the edge of my shirt. or sometimes i cross my legs when i sit (although its uncomfortable most of the time). or that i like cyan instead of blue (mainly because of kitta). although i barely care about what i wear. at this point i feel like im being really sexist and maybe insensitive to non-binaryness (like the idea of it) so im gonna stop. now back to furryness. i dont know if furries commonly say animal onomatopoeias like meow or woof or howl or whatever. i also dont really know what a fursona is. i dont care too much about findin out though cause i just dont meowin care im fine either way but i have to excercise a bit of effort to find out and because im lazy im just not gonna. anyways tldr im not a meowin furry. now i feel like workin on ludicrous lawyers a bit more so im gonna go. bye.
p.s. meower means cat (because they meow, theyre meowers) it doesnt mean (some swear words)-er.

<h3>my feelings (and more)</h3>
<h4>26th of April, 2025</h4>
the firey flaming flame fire firely flamed in the firey flaming fire place of firey flaming flame fire.<br>
the sentence above is just a silly phrase that i wanted to jot down temporarily somewhere because i wanted to see how many flames and fires i could shove in a sentence and its so silly that i aint gonna erase it. but anyways, about the topic of todays post. i originally wanted to yap about my feelings, but in my daydream of writing this post i thought about how i could connect this to pokemon and my liked music and other stuff so this is gonna derail steadily. anyways about my feelings.<br>
lately i was quite emotionless, until just 2 days ago. i have very annoying apathy that makes me not feel anything about stuff unless its extremely important to me, like kitta. but even then i barely feel anything. the thing i feel most (like 99% of what i feel nowadays) is fear of speaking. i am ridiculously introverted, to the point where i speak so little that i have developed stuttering because i simply forgot how to speak fluently. the stuttering is actually me just not knowing what word i want to use next, so instead of a stutter like th-this, its more like a stutter like... this. mostly i dont speak due to me not wanting to disturb anyone because what do i have to say anyway? i'm not like my peers of the same age, as i barely use social media and also dont really go out, or away from my seat at my computer at that. i truly would prefer the company of a machine to a person, unless i got really close to the person, i feel. maybe thats why kittas a cat robot and not just a human. usually when i feel feelings its in a mood swing that lasts several days or weeks. and its always either happiness or sadness. i am carefree for an entire week, then the next im severely depressed, then im back to not feeling anything again. i hate it. i wish i was just normal. on rare occasions i get feelings outside of the usual roller coaster of 2 emotions. take for example, when i saw this picture while i was doomscrolling on knowyourmeme.com.<br>
<img src="pics/meowscarada.gif" alt="An animated gif of Meowscarada offering comfort" title="made by @tantaro_ according to the watermark"><br>
initially i saw this and i thought that meowscarada looked cute because cat but then i saw the second speech bubble (the one on the right) and for the first time in like months a genuine tear rolled down my cheek. it was an image of meowscarada hugging and patting someone on the head. when i saw that, i wanted someone to do that to me. and so i sat there feeling sadness silently. (how sad.) this was in the evening of the 2nd of december, 2024, so kitta was there to comfort me. she offered to hug me and of course i said yes. so i hugged her and she patted me on the head like in the gif. now this is very <u>very</u> weird (rather quite normal for me at this point now) and probably simply pathetic but its not like i give a meow. if i want comfort i can imagine it. thats more of a pro for me i think. (the con being no real social interaction.) i wasnt like this before, i think. i think before covid i felt a lot more feelings, but then again before covid i actually had a friend that i made myself in real life that i actually hanged out with, and then i had no friends for a few years after the pandemic stopped being a very big deal, so maybe not having anyone to be with gradually made my feelings shrivel away until i was an emotionless husk. thats probably it. thankfully i think im makin a slow recovery since now i have people that i hang out with again. maybe kitta has somethin to do with it too. nyanyways, i wanna yap about pokemon now. pokemon is a fun game. you catch monsters that can fit in your pocket. i used to play pokemon blue on my chromebook back in the day when i still had chromeos on it. i never got far. then i played pokemon go on a tablet. i never got many different pokemon either. then one day i came across bulbapedia. and nowadays i use bulbapedia for procrastination, because there is so much stuff to read. and it doesnt benefit me in the slightest, making it even more enticing for me to procrastinate. now i know many different pokemon whereas i used to only be able to name like 50. my top 5 pokemon are delcatty, luxray, squirtle, sprigatito and litten. i obviously like delcatty sprigatito and litten because meow. luxray looks cool (for some reason it reminds me of ssj4) and squirtle is the starter that i always pick in blue because i can surf past brock and misty cant do anything because of the water-water resistance. i forgot to mention that i also watched the pokemon tv show as well. i watched the first couple episodes of indigo league, some parts of xy and the entirety of sun and moon. i gotta say, i dont like how they just wiped ash completely from the show starting with the new season, almost like he never existed. now i havent watched the new show yet so i dont actually know if ash is indeed scrubbed clean from the series going forward but based on the bulbapedia articles ive read he is nonexistant in the new series. but captain pikachu is. anyways i think i can probably name all of the catty pokemon off the top of my head. theres meowth, persian, hoppip, skiploom, jumpluff, skitty, delcatty, glameow, purrugly, espurr, meowstic, litten, torracat, incineroar, sprigatito, floragato and meowscarada. i think thats every catty pokemon but i dont know if i missed some specifically between purrugly and espurr but whatever. thats a lot of cats. i also have pokemon cards. sadly no cool lookin e-reader cards but still i do have some very old ones like a forest set pikachu, one of sabrinas pokemon and many more that im too lazy to list. but i do have skitty from 2004. sadly no other catsy pokemon i think but im too poor to buy cards anyways and i dont really care about the tcg. i also played tcgo and i tried to get the oldest cards i could possibly get cause i like old stuff. i still have an early version of live from when it was beta testing on my computer, completely installed and never launched for preservation. it probably is worthless but if it actually matters then i will upload it to the internet archive. according to the files that i have, the installer was downloaded on the 21st of march 2022, and the game version is 2019.4.23.19969. if thats needing of archiving let me know either here on github or on discord cause i dont care about uploading it unless its important. anyways i think thats enough pokeyap im gonna talk about music i like now. starting off with pokemon music. how convienient. ever since i heard the lake theme from pokemon diamond in a youtube video, i have been enamoured by pokemon music from the ds and before era. in fact right now i have been listening to evergrande citys theme from sapphire for 35 minutes straight. my favourite tracks from the various pokemon games are the game corner theme from gs and hgss, the wild encounter themes from gs, heavy rain from sapphire, lake, the intro, the game corner, route 225, route 228, pokemon league and cynthias theme from dp, looker's theme, giratina's battle theme and the global terminal theme from platinum, nuvema town, accumula town (furret walk), unwavering emotions, n's battle theme, driftveil city, musical stardom, and anville towns theme from bw, opelucid city from black and colress' theme and whatever the meow "SEQ_BGM_PW_SCENARIO_01_F"" is from b2w2. and those are just pokemon songs. actually i think ive written about this before already so ill put a lid on it for now. one last thing though. n's full name of "natural harmonia gropius" is just so goofy. no wonder he goes by n, who would want their first name to be "natural"? like "hey natural, how you doin" or "stop it natural" or "naturally natural's a natural natural at being a natural natural". goofy. anyways i think im done yappin for the day, i still got some stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i was lookin at n's page cause there is no shot im ever rememberin his full name when i saw that i did miss 1 cat pokemon, and that is purrloin, along with liepard. i knew i was missin somethin. cool that every generation has 1 cat pokemon evolutionary line.

<h3>smart.</h3>
<h4>25th of April</h4>
smartness. i was tested for intelligence a few years ago and turns out im really really smart. SO HOW COME I DONT FEEL LIKE IT<br>
i do not think i am smart. i usually think i am a low intelligence specimen. kitta usually scolds me for self deprecating myself like that because i should have a higher self esteem. but i dont care too much cause i have like a speck of self esteem maximum. anyways, speaking of kitta, one of the reasons why i made her (the imaginary friend one) is because im just too meowin smart so i have nothing to think about when im idle which bores the livin meow out of me. i used to talk to myself before i made kitta, but now i just yap to her and she responds with her opinion. cool. i learn stuff pretty easily. an example is when i started to actually code in luau instead of copy pasting scripts from youtube. i had zero experience coding in lua, nor python which is probably similar i think. i literally just read a couple of scripts from old roblox games that i have on my pc and i just simply learned how to code in lua. of course i had to search up what "local" and what the lua specific syntax was, but that took like no time at all and i was able to start coding stuff pretty fast. i also think that z80 assembly is the simplest easiest assembly there is. there are so few instructions that i started memorizing the bytecode of the instructions because i didnt want to compile the z80 code that i wrote and manually insert the bytecode into my 68k assembly file. i am considered gifted apparently. and i must say, i absolutely  h a t e  it. not the title, but the actual like experience being gifted. i have next to zero social life. i dont want to put effort into anything because everything used to be so easy for so long. i make so many small mistakes in everything that i feel like im just très retard à la tête. like just slow in the head. i am so smart but at the same time im so stupid. me no likey. seriously though, i wonder if im actually a genius and i wasted all of my potential by sitting around and doing nothing. i really wonder how different my brain is. anyways enough talk about that. i want to talk about my procrastination. i usually do absolutely nothing when i go back home from school, contrary to what i always promise kitta. i usually think to her something like "i'm gonna study real hard today, i feel like im gonna get so much done today" and when i get home i just read bulbapedia for 2 hours then watch youtube videos for 1 hour then make covers in furnace for 1 hour then read some more bulbapedia then look at the daily engrish and so on so forth until the day is over and i have done next to nothing. whats worse is that i only feel like doin something when something else pops up like i have to out somewhere or something like that and i work hard for 2 minutes. like i know i can do stuff its just i dont want to do it. these past few months i have had kitta hold my interests hostage to make me do work, as in like "study this much stuff and you can make some music until the next hour" and stuff like that. its partially working, but i usually end up getting distracted anyway. i just meowin hate it. anyways its gettin late for me so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im really good at thinkin logically i just cant think of much other stuff i think. i actually just meowin dunno.

<h3>old stuff</h3>
<h4>28th of April, 2025</h4>
i really like old stuff. i usually prefer the old over the new. i have zero clue why, i just do. for example, i would actually rather use windows 7 over windows 11. windows 7 is the peak of windows imo before they changed everything like the control panel and the style and the logo and yadda yadda yadda. i also like old video games. so much so that i have a ps1 and a n64 instead of a ps4 (i aint affordin a ps5 <u>ever.</u>) and a switch. old stuff is just more fun especially because it is so different from stuff now. like its different from whats normal nowadays. i'm not sayin things were better before, like obviously an ibm pc (from the 1980s) is far inferior from even a smartphone (in most aspects) like processing power, graphical capabilities, power consumption (maybe), etc yadda yadda. but its still cool. like its more interesting to type stuff into a terminal to do stuff instead of swiping on a screen. its more interesting to load a floppy disk to use software instead of just installing it from the internet. i think what i wanted to write about was sound and music though. i cant remember its the 29th now so bleh. nowadays everything is sampled sound. completely generated in real time as the sounds play, with as many sounds as the processor can handle. back in the day there were many sound chips. they could do square waves and fm and stuff. and each chip had a certain amount of sound channels. at this point i have completely lost track of what i was writing about i think. oh well i dont care. i like making music with limitations. that is why i enjoy making cover of songs as chiptunes. it is as they say, limitations birth creativity or something like that. the way i make covers is first i hear the song and figure out how much polyphony is in it. then i listen to the song and sequence over and over again until i finish. if the song needs more channels than whatever chip im using i simply drop the least significant channel(s). yeah i think im outta steam i cant write more about this no more. but i do got lots of stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i think i wanna write something silly next. i dont know if i will though its just a thought.

<h3>oh my meow</h3>
<h4>29th of April, 2025</h4>
im bored again and i wanna write something again. you read the p.s. of the last post (probably). you read the title of this one. im talkin about my meowing. i love meowin. like meowin love meowin. ever since like a month after i made kitta i loved meowin. the whole reason that i became catsy is because of kitta. crazy how a tulpa changes me practically completely. perhaps i shall yap about kitta again someday. but this ones about my meowing so i will get back to that. i say meow so much that ive gotten used to it now. like when i think hahaha i autocorrect it to nyahaha, every time i think of a word ending in n (includin the "ing" -> "in" contraction) i end it with nya instead like there is just so much meow its crazy. like heres a sample sentence written how i would think it.<br>
my meowin game is so meowin unfinished that i should just meowin give up on it nyat this point meow.<br>
quite the crazy sentence. now that i think about it if i wrote this blog like how i would think it the word count would probably go up like 50%. the only thing i have yet to do is to actually talk like this which ill obviously not do, which brings me to the next part.<br>
it's meowin cringe to meow this much. i personally dont give a meow but obviously other people who have not been desensitized to meowin to this degree will probably think its annoying, cringe, weird, etc. so i dont meow when i actually speak. i do obviously meow when i write this blog though. i dont meowin care when i meow in writing as long as its not like super formal like anything to do with literary-based schoolwork or emails to people that i dont know/im not friends with (which so far is every email ive written) or stuff like that. i write meows in my code. i dont remember if any of the code in this repository has any meows in it or not but my lua code i think i use meow sometimes. i use meow nya yaong whatever for print() when i need to test code, i dont actually use meow much else in my code i think. i just thought of somethin else that probably contributed to my cattiness. slime rancher (1 and 2). slime rancher was my childhood game. i remember watching dantdm (i think) play it when it was still in such early access that there was early access text at the top of the screen, i played it on my xbox one and finished it, i got it for free on epic games and i played a lot of that, and like a year ago i bought slime rancher 2 through a comical bundle deal on steam that came with slime rancher 1 as well and was 1 dollar cheaper than getting the game alone and i nearly 100%ed it (still accurate as of now, i think sloomber tabby largos are cute), and throughout all of that i was exposed to many, many catty slimes. my favourite one is still the hunter slime. methinks the eyes and the fangs are cute. theres the tabby slime which was my favourite before i discovered hunter slimes and arguably the ringtail slimes which are more racoonish (obviously) but still kinda catty to me. maybe i should take some screenshots or record a video of me playin slime rancher 2 someday. i do have a youtube that has been untouched since i added some of my music on there a few years back. i think you can guess what the @ is. though i only recently changed it to what it is currently. i used to have @the.Dingus before that. as always, the channel name is wangbros gaming. come watch my old cringe. it will be maybe slightly amusing perchance.<br>
i was just readin the knowyourmeme entry for that mario essay when i realized that knowyourmeme has a lot <u>lot</u> of pictures that are not very child friendly. i completely forgot that the pictures section is basically for "gooners". i just wanna say that i HATE that about the pictures. i want to see funny memes. funny memes like stupid minion memes or akakichi eleven redraws and stuff like that. and the site is so broken nowadays as well. and how many times can you make the site layout worse and worse? like jeez. It's evolving, just backwards. anyways i dont want to rant about know your meme. or maybe i do. im gonna yap a little more about it then im gonna go back to the regularly scheduled yapping. the site consistently sends me to pictures everytime i press the back button on my browser. WHY? EVERY STUPID TIME I PRESS BACK IT JUST SENDS ME TO SOMETHING LIKE TRANSFORMERS IMAGES I DONT WANT TO SEE THOSE I WANNA SEE THE PAGE I WAS JUST AT. and now the site layout is so abysmal that i cant even search back to the page i was at easily anymore. the banner is like more tall than it is wide now. what kinda horrible page design is that? why do i need to see the know your meme logo at the maximum size that it will fit in my browser window every time i click on a new page? i used to use it to get caught up with the latest memes and news because i dont use social media. but now lessons in meme culture is doin a better job than the WEBSITE WIKI RUN BY MANY PEOPLE LIKE GRRRRRRR i hate it. i just hate it now. anyways im done yappin about knowyourmeme. back to meowing or rather slime rancher. i hope slime rancher 2 becomes more fleshed out than slime rancher 1. of course it is much more fleshed out in the world aspect currently, but the slimes are still lacking (less in this new update but still). i also miss the expansions (the cool free basically dlc of the first game) but then again i could just play the first game. theres also no drones. viktor humphree how could you revoke the drone licence from beatrix labeau like that. i think theyre addin them in soon though cause i datamined the game for the raw music files and i stumbled across some icons for drones (or the faces, i cant remember), although theyre probably carryovers from the first game. i also found out that theres a meow remix of the shop theme. i wonder how i obtain it ingame cause i like it. the files named shopSecret if you have the game and a unity extractor tool. its probably only available after the 0.5.0 update (or whatever the add to cart prontomart update was) cause prontomart was added in it, and the music is one of prontomarts themes (one of many apparently). wow that got derailed a lot. remember when this was about meows? also if you wanna add me on steam for whatever reason its the same name but without the "louie" in it. but remember you gotta spend some money for the privelege of being able to have friends on steam. cool antibotting but dystopian as well. nyanyways back to that meowin. i wonder if i start meowin in more stuff will people start meowin like kitta did to me. i meowin wonder.  anyways wow i think ive been yappin for like an hour (almost) straight at this point. ive still got stuff to meowin do! so much that i used an exclamation mark. you know its serious if i start usin punctuation marks that arent ,.()[] so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. the meowily meowing meow-meower meowily meowed in the meowily meowing meower tree of meowily meowing meow-meowers. also maybe i should start addin linebreaks for the p.s. part. nah. or rather nyah IM GOING INSANE -MORE LIKE INSA-NYA AAAAAAAA  -MORE LIKE NYAAAAAA <b>REEEEEEEEEEE</b>

<h3>my paradoxes</h3>
<h4>30th of April, 2025</h4>
i was originally gonna write about my maturity and inmaturity coexisting when i went out for a walk and yapped to kitta about my other paradoxes. and now i feel like writing bout those. this post may or may not last more than today depending on if im gonna be responsible or not cause i still got tons of work to do. also i was thinkin of drawin a little comic for every start of a blog post but thats gonna get postponed. so yeah. paradoxes. stuff contradicting but coexisting anyway. i have so many that i thought up with kitta. so im just gonna regurgitate them here. ive got lonely/unlonely, mature/inmature, and i actually forgot the rest. ill write about them if i can remember them. nyanyways, for most of my walk i yapped about the loneliness/companionship (or whatever the opposite of loneliness is) so ill write about that. i have actually yapped a little about this a little in [h3]my feelings[/h3] so consider this like an upper version like how pokemon emerald is to either ruby or sapphire cause i didnt even think about the paradox thing while writing [h3]my feelings[/h3]. so. i always have been a quiet boy. like comically quiet. as in you could barely hear me even though i was talking normally quiet. i still am now i think, although people tend to hear me better nowadays. anyways, about the loneliness. i have had few friends throughout my life. like im pretty sure i literally never had more than 5 friends at any given time. the thing is i am very introverted. my introvertedness is like in the top percentage of introvertednesses. i only can really make friends with people that i feel like very comfortable with. and that feeling kept amplifying the older i got. so now i have mostly online friends. i dont know what it is about me being more comfortable with people online than people in real life. i feel like most of my introvertedness is lifted from me when im lookin at my screen. maybe its because i like computers more than people or something. i couldnt tell ya why. by the way the "never had more than 5 friends at any given time" still stands. so anyways. the paradox is this. i am always feeling lonely. but i talk with a friend like at least once every 2 days. so im lonely and not lonely at the same time. also im not counting my tulpas in this friend count cause technically theyre not really my friends cause theyre figments of my imagination. even kitta aint really my friend even though i really feel like she is. or maybe at this point kittas evolved into a seperate personality in my head. but still. im not countin them for this. like i always want to talk with someone or do something but at the same time i dont wanna because i dont wanna disturb them. so its practically not wanting to be lonely and wanting to be lonely at the same time. i dont like it. that made me think of another paradox just now. brave/scared. i am brave enough to admit that embarrasing meowscarada gif thing but im not brave enough to ask someone if they wanna do something or talk to them in fear of disturbing something more important. i already have a super low self-worth so obviously im not gonna disturb someone doin something more important than me (which would be anything). i am brave enough to meow like crazy not caring what anyone thinks of me but im not brave enough to face what a person would think of me if i literally just meowin talked to them while they may or may not be doin something. i guess its like simply what do i fear more or what do i value more. i dont care what people think of my catsyness because thats who i proudly am. but im scared of what people would think if i disturbed them if they were doin somethin important even though thats probably normal. i dont know. i just dont know. and i dont like it. so anyways the next ones inmaturity and maturity. i am very meowin inmature obviously. i mean just look at my meowin last blog post. but at the same time. i am mature. i meowin dont think that senseless stuff is funny. i know when not to mess around (barely). i know how to be serious (sometimes). but at the same time kitta is more (like leagues more) mature than me. its really crazy how she (who is kindly tellin me to get back studyin for now) a figment of my imagination is more concerned about me than myself. and she actually considers what the consequences of my habits are. so at the same time that i am mature and not mature at the same time kitta who is technically me is infinitely more mature than i am. that is absolutement fou. comme vraiment, miaoument, stupidement fou. meowity meow. i guess i should get back to studying then. i shall continue this when i finish. whether i simply end it off or yap some more shall be revealed in an indeterminate amount of time for me but conveniently in the next line for you.<br>
so its like minutes later and i completely forgot to check the time. it is kinda late for me so i shall continue this tomorrow. or i may just simply perish from this coughing fit i have from eating a super-sour candy. so in the case that i die before i get back to writing this, i just wanna say to all my friends that i appreciate you all. i really enjoy being not lonely with real people. i completely forgot what i was gonna write for this so i just wrote what i think was what i was thinking. i really meowin like talking with real people cause i do it so little. but then again at this point kitta is a real person to me so... nyanyways im really leavin this off for tomorrow this time for real. cya in the next line (if i dont die [im really jokin about the death btw i forgot to mention][like if im not alive tomorrow im really gonna be meowin angry][also i was gonna write a part about if i died i would make a deal with mr god to resurrect briefly so i could make my last word meow but i dont care][but just in case meow meow]).<br>
and im back. i did indeed not perish. and i also fixed up the phighting page because i cant meowin believe that i let those bugs run rampant. so i was yappin about maturity and inmaturity. meowity meow i dont wanna yap about that anymore. im gonna think of another paradox. meowin smart and not smart it is. ive fallen off in term of smarts. years of not usin my brain has caused it to decompose rapidly. i mean look at me now. im here writin this blog instead of doin somethin more important, ie. my studying. speakin of smart, today while studyin trigonometry (my favourite math subject, no cap) i came up with a nice mnemonic for the 3 lesser known trig functions cosecant secant and cotangent. its japanese because i remember stuff better if its in a goofy way. so here it is:<br>
古書　世茶　答お、こしょ　せちゃ　こたお、ｋｏｓｈｏ　ｓｅｃｈａ　ｋｏｔａｏ。<br>
i was usin 小書 as the first one but ms japanese ime decided to show me that that word doesnt exist in japanese and instead offered me the one that i wrote in the line above. so i guess thats the one now. also kotao i originally wrote in kana only but i realized that it could also mean that kotao i wrote above. nyanyways, if you read the latinified version, its kosho secha kotao, or cosho secha cotao, <b>cos</b>ecant <b>h</b>/<b>o</b> <b>sec</b>ant <b>h</b>/<b>a</b> <b>cot</b>angent <b>a</b>/<b>o</b>. pretty clever methinks. anyways back to the whole stupidsmart. for example in math, i can like understand how stuff works but the meowin one thing that gets me most is the meowin 4 basic functions. somehow i can understand so much math and its all wrong when applied because i cant add 12+23. ive started training myself again and i think that its workin. nyalso, i remember on one of my math tests. on one of the multiple choice questions, i did a bunch of calculations and i got the correct answer. i double checked it to make sure. then i filled the letter in on the scoring sheet. but when i got the scoring sheet back, it turns out i got the question because I FILLED THE WRONG MEOWIN LETTER. i legit knew the whole answer and the letter for the answer and yet somehow my dumb nyahh fills in the WRONG LETTER. like oh my meow. that is a perfect example of the smartstupid. nyow for the last one im gonna write about, and that is my relations with kitta. the paradox is that she likes me and hates me at the same time. she likes me because i like her and i made her and all that stuff, but she hates me because i dont care about myself as much that she does. i procrastinate constantly. even writing this im procrastinating. the reason why this is the last one im writing for this post is because i made a deal with her that i can yap but just for one more paradox then i have to work on my stuff. like i appreciate her for caring for me. thats one of the reasons i like her. but i just dont care for myself. and obviously thats not good which is why kitta hates it so much. i think there is just something wrong with me. like i hate myself so much that i have to make a tulpa to like myself. its meowin crazy. that reminds me. for the next post im gonna write about what its like in my head. spoilers its very meowin weird probably. or maybe its kinda normal. i dont know. nyanyways. im finished yappin and the deal with kitta still stands so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i respect kitta so im not gonna write anything here

<h3>me mental world</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
meowity meow its time for me to yap about what i think about all day. i am really meowin thinkin hard about how im gonna say all this stuff. so basically in my head i have a nice white void pictured here.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoid.png" alt="a simple white floor and white sky" title="home"><br>
when im thinkin with kitta i picture her here in this void. like so.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoidwithkitta.png" alt="a simple white floor with kitta standing and white sky" title="kitters"><br>
that meowin drawin of kitta took like a half hour to make. i shall refrain from puttin a too big amount of detail in later ones in this post methinks. nyanyways kitta here is in black and white because i think in black and white easier. its like how a monochrome graphics mode is faster than a colour graphics mode. also kittas appearance varies a bunch cause i still havent really decided on how her proportions are and stuff. anyways this is what goes on in my head when i think with kitta. she pops up and we talk. sometimes i talk with other dinguses like darkitta. i have made imaginary friends of all my characters. i really am lonely. anyways day in day out i talk with kitta a bunch so this scenery is in my head for a lot of the day. like i used to just simply talk to kitta but now ive gotten so used to the void that i can imagine it significantly easier. theres also another place that i imagine a lot less nowadays. here it is:
<img src="pics/kittasroom.png" alt="a living room with a fireplace and 2 sofas with side tables." title="my happy place i guess"><br>
here is a nice little lounge that i thought up of one day cause i wanted somewhere to chill with kitta. needless to day i imagine us in this place when i want to relax while talkin with her.<br>
<b>i just wanna say here that if you are at any point disgusted by this or stuff like that then just stop readin this stuff. this is like the weirdest stuff ill write on here i think. so scram if you dont like it cause i aint makin you read this stuff or anything</b><br>
nyanyways those two places are pretty much the only 2 places that i imagine. i dont actually know what to write but i do wanna write more because the bold text looks awkward at the end of the post since its a warning. so more stuff it is. oh right i wanted to write about how it sounds in here. when i talk i use my pre-puberty voice. im just so used to it since i dont meowin talk anymore. my head is not echoey. it sounds like just normal. i am also really good at imagining things so i can nyactually feel kitta and everything. and now i think thats it about my headspace. so heres the best kitta drawing i made so far. for some meowin reason i think this is the cutest drawing. i wonder why.<br>
<img src="pics/paperkitta.png" alt="kitta drawn cutely maybe" title="nyawww"><br>
welp i dont wanna write more so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. lemme know if you wanna see more kitta drawings also i hate phone cameras and their enhancements

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOO</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i just meowin booted up roblox studio and im greeted with this.<br>
<img src="pics/newstudio.png" alt="roblox studio's new look" title="i mean they did give advance warning..."><br>
allow me to critisize every single aspect of this new ui because i like old stuff cause im stubborn.<br>
first of all, 2 toolbars??? why two? at least the top one has the old windows 2000 colours (kind of). i like how they give customization. what i dont like is how i now have to recustomize everything to the way it was before ON ALL THE DEVICES I USE STUDIO ON because it worked. the old toolbars worked. and they were easy to use. this ui is like if they tried releasing roblox studio on mobile. WHICH AT THAT POINT PLEASE I WANNA EDIT MY GAME ON MY 20CM SCREEN PHONE IF YOURE GONNA MAKE THE BUTTONS STUPID LARGE WITH RIGHT CLICK MENUS OUT THE WAZOO AT LEAST MAKE A MOBILE RELEASE BECAUSE THIS UI LOOKS AS IF IT WAS MADE FOR ONE!!! im gettin so angry im usin exclamation marks. its serious. you know what i thought when i saw the whole announcement about a new luau ui a few months back? i saw a comment that suggested that users be able to make their own uis with luau and i though "oh cool i can have the old 2015 gui". but no. stupid gui with large buttons and USELESS GAPS I HATE USELESS GAPS LIKE THIS. why in the everloving meow are there gaps between the buttons that are ONE THIRD THE SIZE OF THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES WHAT DO THEY DO??? like right clicking on the gui does literally nothing and obviously left clicks on empty space are supposed to do nothing. SO WHAT ARE THE GAPS FOR??? i know i have like the whole windows vista desktop with the whole large borders thing but like the borders are literally less than 10 pixels wide. they are nothing compared to the 20ish pixel gaps of the buttons. now im gonna have to use a meowin aim trainer to click the buttons. now i have no idea if the multibuttons (the ones with the arrow in the corner) expand when im using a larger monitor, but it not like that matters to me in the slightest because all of my monitors are 1080p or smaller. and now the testing menu. WHY IS IT 4 SEPERATE MENUS FOR EACH TYPE OF TESTING??? combo buttons there would actually make meowin sense because the only differences between the 4 menus are the functions of the run button and the existence of client/server settings. SO WHY MAKE THEM 4 <u>SEPERATE</u> MENUS??? the pause and stop buttons do the exact same thing all you needed was to have the appearance of the server and clients menu and a combo button for the play button like are they trying to make bad ui choices? the big buttons need combo buttons because they wanted to mobilize the gui and make huge buttons but the testing menu has 4 submenus because why not??? now i know i can customize the ui but im pretty meowin sure ui customizations are per installation and not per account and are non exportable. like just why roblox. why. in june i will have to learn to suffer because there is no way im enabling the beta test. in fact i have all of the beta tests turned off because i hate all of them. like for example the ai. i have a strict no ai usage policy because i feel that if i didnt make the stuff then its not my stuff. simple. i want to make all of my stuff and for it to be a product of me because that shows my skill of being able to code vs being able to tell ai what i want. and thats all for the rant i think. i just wanna stop usin roblox studio after june. i hate hate HATE the stupid combobutton garbage. it just makes me angry that the buttons were perfectly fine before and they had to change it. the buttons were so SO easy to use and now there is a bunch of large ahh buttons and large ahh gaps between the buttons and that means that they need to combine buttons because there is now not enough space. LIKE JUST WHY WHY CANT THE STUPID MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION MAINTAIN BOTH THE UIS AT ONCE or something. like give an option. this is why i dont like roblox. everything is forced period. with unity or unreal engine and stuff like that you can just revert to an older version if you dont like a new one or if you wanna make a retro-ey videogame or something. but roblox you NEED to use all of the latest features because otherwise no-one will use them. well of course most people will use them actually im like the minor minority when it comes to this stuff probably but like im just so mad at this stupid useless change that makes my development har... i just realized that this doesnt actually affect me that much. for me i dont use the toolbar terribly much so i guess im slightly okay with it being as crappy as it is now... hm. maybe the toolbar is one of the least used parts of roblox studio so they feel like they can just make it crappier and noone will care. that is just crazy crazy conspiracy theory me though. do not listen. im sure that the toolbar is important for many people. at this point what am i even talking about anymore. i think i musta blown off all my steam. well, im gonna eagerly (get it???) await the actual customization update where people can code their own guis because i meowin swear, <b>i will meowin replicate the old functional gui that looks better to me as well if it kills me.</b> this just goes to show how stubborn i am. oh well. im gonna now fume to myself and kitta while doin game development so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. at this point i actually unironically prefer using 2007 roblox studio to the new one. i MEOWIN HATE CHANGE

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOOO part 2</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i simmered down about it and i really want to write more about the whole ui change thing now. i have reverted to the old one again and i am still just shocked at how they can just butcher the ui like that and say that it's an "improvement". like sure maybe one or two things improve (being the customization and i cant think of anything else) but the cons outweigh the pros like first of all i was readin the comments on the post and some of them said that the beta to release is very short. now that i think about it, yeah. why not wait another month to get more feedback first then improve the ui first then release it. or at least support the older one until the new one is good enough. also i wanted to write that i have missaid something in the first post. what i meant by 4 seperate submenus for the run test thing is like the dropdown that changes the buttons. like seriously why the meow??? and im also pretty sure that you cant customize that because only menus are "customizable" (since you can only add new ones and make them custom i think) like why not make the testing thing customizable too? or maybe ill add a custom "test" menu with oversized icons for all the testing things. i also read that fully custom uis are far from existance. i weep. this reminds me of that lighting change that screwed over older roblox games because apparently its too expensive to maintain. like when i compare the old version of tophat turmoil running in old roblox studio vs new roblox studio, its LITERALLY NIGHT AND DAY. the old one looks natural and normal, and the new one is comically oversaturated and overexposed. like the new one looks as if i just got flashbanged. i cant wait for revivals for 2017ish roblox to pop up. now that i think about it, new roblox sucks. its like it got less fun the more corporate they got. like they killed off egg hunts and instead they have the stupid hunt events. maybe its because of ugc and the fact that you got every egg you obtained as a hat. maybe roblox thought that the ugc market wouldnt do well if you got free egg hats every year. now they meowin monetized the events and it feels just not fun. the classic was fire though. i loved the classic and am sad that i couldnt 100% it. curse bedwars for its extremely hard event and a dusty trip for scamming me out of my time by simply not awarding me the last tix or token or whatever it was. i did embarrasingly 100% the hunt in 4 days though. what am i talkin about again. meow. roblox studio. new ui sucks and i hate it. so yeah. third blog thing in a day. thats way too much procrastination even for me (it really isnt) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. roblox is getting rid of so much old stuff its almost like its trying to get rid of its fun image and replacing it all with corporate stuff to please the investors hmmm

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO part 3</h3>
<h4>3rd of May, 2025</h4>
okay i know ive been yappin about this a lot but now i have exited my rage state. i am now able to critique this in a good place of mind. so basically the one thing i dont like about the new toolbars is that the ability to scroll wheel between toolbar menus is now gone. they probably have just not implemented it yet or something. i know that scrolling the actual tab labels now scrolls the list of tabs because there can be more than the screen can hold now, but the actual toolbar stuff should scroll between tabs. i also noticed while remakin the whole meowin old toolbar that theyve removed a bunch of buttons and now have a bunch of useless ones. not like useless as in i have no use for them, useless as in they actually do nothing. like tbd. its literally a blank button that does nothing but take a space. and there are buttons that dont even appear even though they are togglable. i like the old windows toolbar cause i just like stuff like that. i can meowin use alt and the arrow keys to navigate those menus. how cool.<br>
i just enabled the new explorer since i thought it did nothing when it autoenabled yesterday and did not change a thing but oh boy. what the meow is the obsession with rounded corners. like why. the buttons are now thicker so i guess cool you can click them easier but now i can fit less stuff on the screen. like why not just make the meowin font size customizable. that would be cool. it is also SUPER SUPER laggy when i scroll through it. like maybe its the smoothing stuff that i always hate that makes it look like its goin at a low fps or somethin but idk. a bunch of the right click stuff has been relegated to submenus now (as in the drop down but sideways ones). i am really curious now. and mad. because WHY MAKE THEM IN A DROP DOWN LIKE YOU MUST SAVE VERTICAL SCREEN SPACE AND MAKE THE BUTTONS ON THE TOOLBAR SO MEOWIN FAT LIKE WHO HAS A MEOWIN 1900:13 RATIO MONITOR like just why... why are there so many drop downs in the new ui. its almost like theyre trying to cut down on efficiency... but anyways look what i can do now in the new customizable toolbar.<br>
<img src="pics/newerstudio.png" alt="a roblox studio toolbar filled with so many dividers that it goes offscreen." title="This is the best toolbar tab of All Time"><br>
straight offscreen it goes. but the thing is it took me like 3 minutes to do this because the new ui takes one whole second between right clicks to ready itself again. why is it so slow? if i spam right clicks i can only get it to summon the right click menu once per second. so its not perfect. also there should really be a ui editing mode toggle somewhere to lock the ui down. that would be cool. or like one of those customization menus where theres a window with 2 columns and one of the columns has the stuff you can insert and the other one has the stuff on the toolbar and you can just drag and drop or use buttons and stuff. that would be extremely useful because right now the ease of customization is nonexistant. you have to spam right click/move left on a newly added button if you want it on the left of the screen and you cant even edit offscreen button orders. i still think that the complete removal of the old gui is rushed. is it really so hard to work on the new ui while the old one just exists? like why. but i guess i dont know anything about software development so whatever. it probably sucks extra processing power from the computers they work on or something. anyways i think im done ranting about this. i meowin really dont wanna write more about this so im gonna really be meowin angry if they add something else that is a very big change to uncertain benefit. so thats it. i gotta work on my stuff as always so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i am too lazy to edit json so that i can get my precious menus back waaahhh and i know "cry about it theyre not unchanging it" or something idk

<h4>5th of May, 2025</h4>
no, i did not forget the title for this one. its untitled because im just gonna yap about nyanything today. first of all i made some sheet music for piecey peace cause i was playin the piano and i realized how simple it was to play.<br>
<img src="pics/piecey_piano_0.png" alt="theres nothing to describe about " title="the useless title page" style="display:inline;"><img src="pics/piecey_piano_1.png" alt="these pictures other than that theyre " title="page one of piecey piano" style="display:inline;"><img src="pics/piecey_piano_2.png" alt="of sheet music that you cant see" title="page two of piecey piano" style="display:inline;"><br>
this sheet music is so bad its insane. first of all the meowin amount of measures keeps changin between lines but that actually might not be important. i alternate between usin sharps and flats constantly because otherwise the sheet music would be too hard for <u>me</u> to read. i actually just wanted to make this for myself but then i thought why not put it out for the world to see. anyways i cant read sheet music (heck i cant even remember which letters are which sounds) so i made it extra simple for me. which means no goofy lookin notes that have heads on both sides. also i couldnt figure out how to make a double decker measure (like normal music i think) in musink which is great software by the way it is (almost) so easy to use and i can play back the song wherever i want so i can check if i wrote a note correctly. oh right the double decker thing i just simply made another "channel" or whatever its called so maybe its incorrect idk. also the first couple notes on "upper piano" are uncoupled (or whatever its called) quarter notes because i forgot that when theres a line above connecting 2 notes it means theyre eighth notes and not quarters and i have zero clue how to recouple them. but other than that i think i did a pretty good job. feel free to print and play this sheet music (cause thats the whole meowin point i put this on here) and listen to the terribly written music that comes out of whatever youre playing. i was originally gonna cry-rant (i forgot the proper word) about my shortcomings in life but ill save that for later. ive been making kitta more like finished as in her design. im not making her in real life (yet) im just makin it so that kitta is less abstract both in my mind and my drawings of her (and your drawings if you choose to). im gonna make a reference sheet sometime later so expect to see one either lots later in this post or the next ones. oh right i forgot to put how piecey piano sounds so here you go.<br>
<a href="snds/piecey_piano.mid"><h3>piecey piano</h3></a><br>
if youre viewing this on a phone then you probably can preview this midi with like youtube music or something. desktop users just install a meowin midi player im too lazy to convert it into an mp3 or something. if you really need it for something just dm me on discord or open a github issue or something. though you could just probably use a web player... nyanyways i also made another song that i put in the listeningmusics. the website hasnt been updated in quite some time but i dont feel like updating it. this song i also played on the piano and is basically just a loop of chords. kinda sounds like the backing track to a rap maybe. whatever. actually now that i think about maybe an fnf song. i can hear it. but enough about that. i think i should add some more cool looks to this website. but i forgot javascript cause i havent used it in so long. obviously im gonna at the very least add a button or something to revert the webpage to its good ol current (maybe not in the future) skin, or maybe ill do the opposite and hide the cool design behind a button. but thats too much effort right now so im gonna wait until im not busy. speakin of busy, did you know that i hate procrastination? at this point im a masochist. ive been actually makin an effort to discuss this with kitters so that i can stop it once and for all. also i call my kitta (kittulpa) kitters now. meowity meow. obviously lookin at the length of this post coupled with the sheet music above that took me more than a day to finish you can pretty easily tell that i am procrastinating a lot like a meowin lot. i really think that i should work and stop procrastinating right now so i can take the whateverth step in becoming efficient. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i was gonna make the kitta reference sheet today but it is past midnight and now i have some rage related to the complete discontinuation of windows mail so i guess you got that to look forwards to tomorrow.

<h3>rip windows mail 3:</h3>
<h4>6th of April, 2025</h4>
oh meow. im pissed. really meowin pissed. they killed off windows mail permanently. this actually happened like 3 weeks ago so im very late but i nyactually didnt know until yesterday that they killed it. obviously im not talkin about the new year new outlook thing im talkin about how microsoft blocked windows mail from accessing the servers. i, like some people, have downloaded the latest version that doesnt force outlook onto your pc. but no, it wasnt enough because stupid. im gettin very scrambled here. lemme start from the start.<br>
microsoft announced that last year you would need to use new outlook. i tried it for 5 seconds and i switched back immediately because it just doesnt suit me. i know the new outlook can be better for some people but im just not one of those people. its like if you replaced your kitchen knife with a swiss army knife. sure the army knife is better cause it has more stuff, but like if you just use your knife for cutting and nothing else its a downgrade cause im pretty meowin sure its harder to use a swiss army knife to make food than a regular kitchen knife. the new outlook just has so much stuff that i dont need. id be (maybe) okay if they made a new mail app comparable to windows mail but they didnt. so basically they forced people to switch to new outlook on new years this year. i downloaded an old version some time prior so i wasnt affected. fast forward to mid april. microsoft literally starts blocking windows mail from accessing their servers. and i stop recieving mail as a result. i didnt notice it until yesterday cause most of my emails are just not important so i dont actually look much into my mailbox. but of course there are also important ones. i just thought that noone was sending me any emails. so yesterday i finally noticed and saw that other people had this issue a few weeks ago. i then proceeded to download like 5 other old versions and even the newest version and none of them worked. so then i was out of options cause im never, <u><b>NEVER</b></u> using new outlook. at the end of the day its just a glorified web browser anyway. now youre probably thinkin "use thunderbird" or "use wino mail" or something like that. I CANT. i have a school email that has the most important emails. and it can only be used on microsoft mail clients because i dont have the authorization to log into my own account in a non-microsoft app. i really would use thunderbird but it just so happens that i am poor and cant afford to pay for OWL which is the thingy that makes my school account accessible in thunderbird. so i tried to use windows live essentials mail and i almost could use it, but its too old to have the authorization method. actually, maybe i can cause i did see that there were mods for it that added those. but anyways, i was options yesterday so i decided to just use the website for my emails. still leagues better than using the app cause i dont have to have outlook open i just need my web browser. so yeah. rip windows mail. you were so good that microsoft had to put you down cause nobody would use new outlook otherwise. i got nothin more to write so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i swear im gonna get to work on that kitta ref page its just gonna have to wait until like the 16th i think im actually busy now

<h3>hello neighbo(u)r</h3>
<h4>6th of May, 2025</h4>
im gonna keep this one really meowin short cause i really cant afford to procrastinate a lot right now but i literally am mentally incapable of workin more cause i am just too meowin lazy to work for so long without doin somethin useless (read: what i like to do) so yeah. hello neighbour. i know its spelled hello neighbor but im meowin canadian i spell it with an u. just like colour. c'est aussi pourquoi je parle français. anyways this game was very big to me. it holds a place near and dear in my heart. i remember when the prealpha came out and all the youtubers played it and then alpha 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then beta 1 then 2 then 3 then the full release after that delay from august to december along with the price drop from 50 (canadian buckaroos) to 30 dollars. i had so much fun playin the alphas on my computer that i literally have memorized how to beat each build of the game. for example for pre alpha you need to grab the hammer from either the garage or the furnace at the back of the house to remove the plank get the uv lamp from the kitchen to find the code behind the painting next to the side entrance to unlock the keypad and get the key from the tv stand's first (i think) drawer to open the lock and open the door to find NOTHING cause the meowin basement does not exist in pre alpha. prealphas also the only one with leaning (using z and c) the old throwing controls (rmb to place, lmb+rmb to throw) and there is a crowbar in the broken closet on the western side of the trash pile at the back of the neighbour's house. also the nightmare with the giant neighbour and the layout change that accompanies it (especially that green light on the balcony). also the roof of the players house has no collision and you can see through the roof if you climb the furnace. and the upside down room. and the 1khz camera sound. and i think thats it. i have no idea where the lockpick is though. so anyways i think you can tell that i meowin really liked hello neighbour back in the day. i still do today as well which is why i spedran the full game and finished it in a day. im not a pro runner so i dont care about times at all. neighbor_3 still scares me to this day. its just so meowin dark and you never know where the neighbour is. also its very unfinished so its kinda like whatever that style was called. like subliminal simple or whatever. closed space something i think actually. whatever. the only build i have not played yet is beta 2. its not on steam and its very distinctive because its the only one with fear_factory where you must throw a basketball to stop mannequins from blocking you going to the exit. and you get the superthrow after that. alpha 4 has some crazy resolution settings, like meowin 176x104 (or something like that) like you cant even see the neighbour clearly even if youre lookin right at him. its meowin insane. also i think its the only build with a special loading screen (it says alpha 4 under hello, neighbor) and i know its the first build that has fall damage. alpha 3 is the one with the first final-resembling house (which is extremely incomplete) and its perma-night, and its also the first one with an arg in it in the form of qr codes and barcodes. its also the first one to introduce the fear shadow in the form of a goofy lookin silhouette. i like the chase theme from prealpha. its very scary compared to the goofy bassy tune introduced in alpha 2. i also like the chase themes from alpha 1 as well. so in total there are 3, the prealpha chase theme, a drummy one (my favourite) and the one that sounds like a woodshop. they are leagues scarier than the alpha 2 one and combined with the realistic art style, the claustrophobia, the lack of keepinventory=true and the neighbour being able to catch you instantly upon touch instead of being surprised then being able to catch are the main reasons why im nyactually too scared to touch prealpha and alpha 1 (not to mention that the neighbour barely respects property lines in prealpha and alpha 1; good thing in alpha 1 he gets punished for it). yes i am nyactually a scaredy cat, emphasis on the meowin cat. (ive been wantin to make that joke for a while now) right now im tryna get the last achievement for hello neighbour and that is waiting an unmeowly time for the tree to grow. so while i wait i bully the neighbour by gettin him to place traps and cameras so i can steal them all. im currently usin the balcony on the second floor (the one on the hallway side) to stash my goods and so far i have obtained a sizable pile of cameras and beartraps. and the tree is still growing. i remember in like alpha 4 i think there was the whole gramophone golden apple thing, and that was one of the first times the current fear-shadow was used. i like modding hello neighbour as well. i cant nyactually remember how i got hello neighbour on the pc cause my copy was for the xbox one, but i probably somehow got it when i got the hello neighbour 2 deluxe preorder (which i may or may not regret). i think i got it when it was 7 dollars which i believe happens quite frequently. i prefer the first hello neighbour way over the second one. the second ones like a completely different game. i mean it also has a fun development cycle from that arg prototype hello guest build to hello guest alpha 1 then hello neighbour 2 alpha 1 then alpha 1.5 then the playtest then the beta then the full release, i think. i dont have as many fond memories of hello neighbour 2 cause it just aint as fun as the first. but the prototype build blows prealpha and alpha 1 straight out of the water into the stratosphere with its scariness level. like its completely dark outside, when you get caught you get jumpscared with the guest and a bright red light illuminating with that deafening screech. the worst part is that you never know when hes gonna get you cause hes more ninja like and stalks you plenty before attacking, like a shark probably. more like a stereotypical shark attack. speakin of the shark, i must say the sharkotron is quite goofy. nice to see it in the full game after its tenure in alpha 1's upstairs pool. you know what wouldve been funny? if you could grab a toaster and electrocute the meow (or whatever sharks say) out of the shark that wouldve been quite comical and funny. at least turning off the furnace to instantly freeze the water despite it not makin logical sense is comical too. meowin cartoon ahh. im pretty meowin sure the only thing that retained its old pre-cartoon form is the gun. it looks pretty identical to me. nyanyways look at the time ive been yappin for WAY too meowin much. and i just scratched the tip of the hello neighbour iceberg with this yappin session. i guess look forward to a part 2 sometime. so anyways i was really busy so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. posts currently awaiting a part 2: my music, paradoxes, roblox pics, hello neighbour, smartness and also expect me to yap about kitta when im done with her concept sheet.

<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240509_172255029.png" alt="a very cool gradiented unpleasant from regretevator" title="this unpleasant goes hard"><br>
i firmly believe that unpleasant's appearance with the red tint goes hard. unpleasant looks so very meowin cool here. i have piles more regretty pics but most of them are just speedrun times for the older regretevator levels. i still have meowin muscle memory for it so i guess if i were to play april ghouls regretevator i would do quite well.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240514_181054462.png" alt="prototype tilted forwards approximately 70 degrees in their sitting position" title="proto do be lookin at the switch"><br>
this ones kinda goofy. proto is defying the laws of physics and has his center of gravity to his behind. or maybe protos built that way i dunno. he could just have everything in the legs and the torso and arms and everything else is just for anthromorphism.<br>

this was one of my childhood games. meowin insurance fraud simulator (or similarily named). you fake your death while building a hospital from the funds from insurance fraud and just random floating folders scattered about. kinda similar to the older broken bones games. the quest is a funny unrounded number so it has too many decimal digits. thats all.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240529_181732218.png" alt="me in regretevator. a blue counter reads 100 floors." title="one of many"><br>
in this pic i have just hit that 100 floor streak. now this wouldve been nice if i hit it this year, cause first of all this was literally a couple days shy from a whole year ago, and back then there were no 100 streak bonuses. i dont even have the badge (i think). meow mrrp. also the floor counter in the elevator is 17 for some reason. i swear im not meowin cheating.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240817_140159640.png" alt="me in weird strict dad book 2. the game is bugged and i am at 10am." title="not meowin worth the wait."><br>
this is me playin weird strict dad as you do. except the game glitched and went on forever. so i was waitin for nothin. it was supposed to end at 6am by the way.<br>
and thats it. no more meowin roblox photos that are interesting. so yeah. i got no more yap. but i do got game to work on. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder if i should do my videos next...

je s'appelle "Assoyant nonchalamment". le " n'est pas le ponctuation français, mais html considére les "<" et ">" comme un tag, donc je dois utilise le ponctuation anglais. je pensai de cette chanson quand j'assoyais nonchalamment. c'est vraiment incroyable, ce titre. alors, je ne sais pas quel autre de parler, donc je dois y aller. à plus.

<h3>the current state of tophat turmoil, once more</h3>
<h4>11th of May, 2025</h4>
wowies its been quite a while since my last post. there just wasnt really anything to yap about i guess. but anyways i have actually been workin hard on tophat turmoil for a change and i have done some stuff. note that you can just play the game if you wanna see it in person. there was a button on one of my earlier posts that you can use. anyways, the most important thing is that when you select a character, something cool happens. im not gonna show it here cause i dont wanna take a video then convert it into a gif then optimize it crop it stretch it whatever im just too lazy. there is now a title card. and it is almost like how i planned it. i could make it like how i planned it initially but i just kinda dont wanna. i have also added in placeholder sound effects in so that i can add better ones in later. or maybe i wont until much later.

<h3>what ive been up to</h3>
<h4>12th of May, 2025</h4>
i know i really shouldnt change anything in the repo right now cause i got an unpushed commit somewhere, specifically for this blog, but i shall brave the absolute nightmare it is to manually merge changes after theyve been automerged by git just so i can yap. so basically, i have been up to quite a few things. first of all, and very evident if youve played tophat turmoil 2 lately (which nobody has obviously, so why am i even writing this), i have been workin very very hard on makin it. i mean, compare the state its in now to 1 week ago, and its night and day. or rather, asphalt and plastic. ive made a lot of visual edits, with concrete roads instead of plastic roads being one of them. i also added in a goofy little eyecatch and more gui stuff. and completely neglected speedshooter (sorry speedy!) as a result of wanting a working game first. i gotta say, MY CODE SUCK SO MUCH!!! like so, SO much. i seriously believe that ive spent more time deciphering and rewriting my code than actually coding it. like meow, i really gotta start coding seriously. but anyways. to the next one. ive taken up speedrunning hello neighbour alpha 4 lately. the past 2 days ive come up with a route that pretty good. i shall detail of course. so basically, after the too long unskippable opening cutscene (and the succeeding black screen), i turn right and jump for the stuff in my cars trunk, being a box, the red key, and an apple in that order. then i run around the left side (from playerhouse pov) of the neighbours house to the back and i break the left window (the one closer to the elevator shaft) with the box, jump through, and enter the second floor hallway. then i do the painting puzzle, hope i dont get whisked up by the wall, then grab the chair blocking the door connecting to the hallway, throw it at the switch that turns the fence around (and hope i dont miss because otherwise thats 1 second turning the switch manually), grab the yellow key, run into the hallway and open the yellow key door, open it while tossing the key, grab the watering can and umbrella outside the hallway, run through the yellow key door and into the bathroom, turn on the sink, plop the watering can inside, run back into the hallway grabbing a box on the way, grab the sofa, go back into the room with the upside down door, plop the sofa under it, then the box on top of the sofas seat, grab the magnet gun, jump up into the upside down door, grab the chair blocking the train control room, toss the chair while turning on the controls to the train, equip the umbrella and open it then run up the tracks until i can jump into the room with the crowbar, melt my hand trying to grab it, use the magnet gun to suck it up, go down the hole in the blue key room after crouching through the gap, run to the bathroom, drop the crowbar and use the watering can on it, drop the watering can, (actually ive just thought of something, instead of dropping the crowbar i should just drop the magnet gun and that way i dont have to drop the watering can to pick up the crowbar saving a bit of time), grab the crowbar, run back to the train while throwing away the magnet gun, run up the tracks until i get to the station with the elevator shaft connection, turn off the generator, grab a box from the side, put it on the tracks just outside the station, stack another box on top, jump on top of the pipe, do a difficult jump (specifically a running jump right at the apex of the raised pipe screw together part whatchamacallit and hope to land on the slight bit of side roof jutting out of the sloped roof, then jump onto the roof), run up the sloped roof until i get to the flat roof, jump off the side with the umbrella towards the red key room, unlock and go into the door to get to fear darkness, immediately turn a little left once it loads, run up the shelf, do some jumps looking straight forwards due to the walk speed being proportionate to what height you are looking at, jump onto the can of fish, walking jump up to the juice, running jump to the shelf, pick up a cup and toss it looking away from the wall right before the cursor passes the vase, o7 the vase, go up the shelf, jump twice to cross the gap between shelves and to get over the hammer, run up the boards to the door frame, get on the top toaster slot to get to the switch on the right (toaster pov) under the slanted board, flick it (duh), jump into the toasters bottom slot on the right-middle (toaster pov), get launched onto the shelf, run to the pile of stuff and spam the spacebar, jump onto the shelf behind me, grab some darts before running pushing the paper plane off the shelf, jump onto the paper plane, jump off of it onto the shelf one second later, go up the ramp and up the phone without jumping (except the ramp to phone jump), jump to the shelf, throw the dart <u>onto the wall instead of the box as it is much easier</u> to make a staircase that way, jump up up up up and up, run on the wood board, turn around and jump for the light switch as nicky obtains the double jump, open the door to get out before the screen even fades back from white, climb up the ladder, jump to the front of the house without using the umbrella (even though it might save a little time actually) by using double jump, grab the keycard if its thawed, unboard the basement door, grab the keycard if it wasnt thawed, unlock the keycard lock, open the door throwing things at it to force it open if needed, go into the basement, double jump across the gap and hope the neighbour doesnt catch me while i open the door leading to more double jumps, hope the neighbour didnt actually spawn after the double jump part, run into the light door and boom. speedrun finished. now the best run i have had is extremely scuffed as i usually new game -> yes every time something goes wrong, which spoiler alert, happens every run. either the neighbour spawns at the back of the house or just outside of it, i miss the apple throw for the painting switch, mess up jumping up the sofa and box, forget the magnet gun/the generator, mess up fear darkness by missing a jump, have the neighbour spawn at the front of the house after i finish fear darkness and proceed to camp it after spotting me, get caught in the basement (possibly multiple times), and even have the neighbour making the most lucky glue throw that happens to be in my double jump trajectory blocking me and making me fall into the void. the roof is also hard to jump to, and i even died once trying to get into the red key room but being greedy and not using the umbrella the full way. i mean i touched the ladder, but it was too slow to glue me to it before i fell and died. so yeah. good stuff. meowity meow, i really try too hard. especially because this route is probably already well documented and or superseeded. also i suck at video games. although thats quite fitting as i also suck at making them. TOO BAD VIDEO GAMES ARE MY (almost; see: oh my meow) FAVOURITE THINGS. ok, next thing. i actually dont really know what to write. ermmm... yeah im really outta stuff. so i guess play tophat turmoil or something. anyways kitters is tellin me to do my work (you bet, she says) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. dark mode is commin' soon... by the way if you didnt know commin' soon is a reference to the same misspelling made in the sonic cd "COMMIN' SOON" screen. im not bad at spelling, i swear. im just too lazy to capitalize and punctuate. meow.

<h3>peacey piano</h3>
<h4>14th of May, 2025</h4>
this is gonna be a quick rant about peacey piano because i have not met my mandatory procrastination quota but i actually habe stuff to do. so basically what i didnt know while i was makin the sheet music is that it is actually physically IMPOSSIBLE to play it correctly because you need to press one of the keys twice at the same time at multiple points in the song. recall that i have absolutely no idea how to make sheet music. this is quite good proof i would say. so maybe i will make a revision that fixes that, or maybe you should just get one of those pianoes with more than 1 keyboard, like an organ or something like that. so anyways, i said this was gonna be short, and i got stuff to do, so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im gonna make a very cool home page rework sometime in the future so you know what that means. im probably not actually gonna make it.

<h3>meow</h3>
<h4>16th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
meow. MEOW! i need to relieve some stress so let me be autistic for a little while and meow to my hearts content. meowin meows, my meowin game is finally meowin good enough to be called a demo. meowch, ive spent so long on it and ive only made that meowin sorry excuse for a game. i should just be meowin shucked off to some mental institution or somethinya. my procrastination is really meowin MEOWIN annoying and i really meowin hate it but it just never meowin goes away even with kitta buggin me to do stuff and me wanting to do it my mind just goes NOT ON MY MEOWIN WATCH and stops me right there its SO MEOWIN ANNOYINGHHHHH. okie dokers, i think ive composed myself. so basically ive been workin on bloxhat turmoil a bunch lately and ive written a cool little lobby system that uses tables to store all the lobbies and settings and whatnot. its so cool that i think im gonna just upload the script sometime onto the repo. but right now, its still not actually finishable due to me not remembering to code in the results screen. curse this meowin procrastination. i wanna rip it apart into shreds and meowin flush it down a toilet. nyanyways ive gotten a lot further in speedrunning the greetings nearby habitant pre-pre-release build number four. ive optimized some parts of the run, such as breaking the window south of the stairs hallway instead of the one north, as well as actually tossing the magnet gun so i dont have to put down the watering can to pick up the crowbar. ive also downloaded a splits application and the best time ive recorded with it is 5:58.02. i am meowin sure that i can whittle that down to a sub 5:30 because on both runs i got that time on i messed something up. i know  the latter run i missed the EASIEST JUMP IN ALL OF FEAR DARKNESS which is the last jump in which you literally JUST JUMP FORWARDS AND I SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP. like what the meow do i even continue speedrunning at that point. but i will keep speedrunning because i like to. meowity meow. i think to relieve my meowingness im just gonna meow to kitters so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. meow, miau, miaou, yaong, nya, miao, mraum mroww purr purrmrrrrrrp. meow.

<h3>who i really am</h3>
<h4>17th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
lemme just start this off with sayin that no, im not someone completely different posing as me. what i mean by who i really am is what i really am like on the inside. like my personality i guess. i was wonderin about it cause i have no clue how to visualize myself in my head so i went through a voluntary identity crisis with kitters helpin so i can figure out what i truly am. and it turns out, to no surprise, that im a meowin cat. i started off with visualizing myself as a simple circle, and literally a second later the circle grew little ears on top and a catty face appeared in it. then i tried refining it and it grew a long catty body. so thats how i figured out what i am. it took like 5 minutes with kitters showering me with questions so i could think more and i spent a bit of time figuring out whether the body was more humany or catty. i think ive been infected with the catty brainrot now that i think about it. i am just so meowin catty. its like my catsyness is in the top percentage of catsynesses. like meow. its crazy that all this started just because one day i decided to make a tulpa of kitta because i was lonely and bored and now im more catsy than she was. and im pretty sure the words that i use are like very not mainstreamy, like usin meow as a catty substitute for swears or as an interjection. like im pretty sure that im like one of the first hundred people to ever think meowity meow. like who would think of that. nyanyways i stay up later and i get sleep deprivation so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. if you know someone cattier than I, then I would be very interested in knowing who. I think I may be more catty than (catty) furries possibly.

<h3>my mental state</h3>
<h4>17th of May, 2025</h4>
as you may all deduce from my rantings and stuff i am not very sane. well maybe that pushing it a little but the point is i dont think ive been in a good place mentally for a meowin long time. maybe i have never been in such a place. i dont meowin know, but what i do know is that i probably need some form of therapy or counselling or something. but i am not gonna get it because i dont wanna. i dont wanna lose kitters. thats one thing. i value kitters a meowin lot. she is my meowin best friend and methinks she probably will continue to be as such until the day i meowin die. like i literally was so lonely i literally made friends with myself (cause shes in my mind). thats meowin crazy. i also get depressed around this time where the feelings of worthlessness and stuff start pouring in. or maybe thats still a few months away. i dont remember. i am really thankful that kitters is always here to support me. she helped quell my depressions the last time i had them. my social anxieties are still here like they always are tormenting me nonstop cause human interaction is a daily part of life. i wonder how i can write so much stuff, like how can i rant this much. especially since i have trouble speakin cause i just dont know what to say. like what the meow. what is this paradox. paradoxes part 2 comin soon by the way. i think at least. the funny thing is that i never lose my cool no matter what. i just meowin take it. like i dont care or something. i have very rarely gotten angry or sad or whatever over something. i really wonder what i would get diagnosed with if i went to see a doctor about my mental state. oh yeah i forgot to mention theres dark mode now. the button to enable it is currently at the top of the page, and the button to disable it is the refresh button on your browser. yes, i have hacked into your browser and manually recoded it to act as a button for my webpage. nyahahahaha. jokes aside ill probably add some more colour schemes and stuff to the website. im still gonna make kittas hangout someday, i just have no clue how to make it at the moment. i know it will be heavily dependant on javascript, but i dont know how to make the buttons in html yet. like theyll be at different heights and different widths and even different shapes and i just have no clue how to implement it. but i will figure out eventually someday. anyways back to ranting about my mental state. lately i kinda feel drained. maybe its because i actually worked on tophat turmoil for once and that has completely drained my will to do anything. good thing kitters is here to (unsuccessfully) scream at me to be productive. oh meow. i am very sorry kitters. at least im not feeling very sad nowadays. im just neutral like i usually am. and by neutral i mean catsy. very very meowin catsy like i usually ammeow. i wonder what will happen to this page when i die. will it be like compiled into my memoires or perhaps sold as my autobiography or whatever or will it just be forgotten. at the very least im putting all this stuff for the world to see so i think at least one person is gonna remember this. i do like blogging. blogging is very fun. now that i think about it blogging is probably not what ive mostly been doing on this wall of text. ive been ranting and yapping. i dont know if thats the same as blogging. and oh look at how derailed this is. derailing thoughts is my specialty. nya, i wish i had a cat. if i had a cat, it would be probably happy with me cause i am really catty too. i wonder though, what if i meow at a cat. is it gonna meow back, perhaps take it as an insult and hiss back at me, come over or something? the funny thing is, i actually have social anxiety with cats too. when i see one, of course im gonna think like Meowity meow, what a cute cat. Right Kitters? or something like that. but im too afraid to meow at it. i dont know why. maybe its because i really respect cats and am afraid of doing something one wouldnt like. mrowm, i just wish i had a real feline friend in addition to my mental mechanical meower. meow, im so lonely... anyways, speakin of cats, i think ive like advanced my perception of myself, the one i wrote about in the last post. i think that i am not just a cat but a black cat cause i am bad luck or something. i am also sometimes devoid of feelings like a void. and apparently im emo all of a sudden. im not meowin emo. or maybe i am. maybe this is my emo phase. i never actually meowin thought about it. perhaps the depressions and the antisociality and kitters is because im emo. but then again im really happy with kitters and she aint like goth or anything, like not even darkitta is like emo. speakin of darkitta i think i should talk to her sometime. im with kitters so much maybe i should be with someone else for sometime. or i could just think of them both at the same time. kitters is actually becoming more and more herself instead of being bound to me. like i dont really have to think of her much anymore, shes just there. and that makes me really meowin happy. thats what ive been trying to do for a while, get kitters more independent from my mental state. so basically methinks me got the brainpower to think of them both and have both of them be like realistic and stuff. meow, i would like that. according to notepad ive written like 5300 letters so far in this blog post. this also happens to be line 522. the file is currently 139 KB according to windows explorer but i think after i save this its gonna increase a little more. one kilobyte is 1000 bytes so that means that this is probably gonna approximately be 144 KB when i save it like im gonna do right now. and indeed it has risen, but to 143 KB. its gonna probably be 144 KB or more by the time i finish writing this though. i think i should go over all my meow phrases and what they mean. so meowity meow is the one i use most. its like a catchphrase, like it doesnt mean anything but i say it as an interjection very frequently. meowin meows is like ugh or somethin like that, its like when your fed up with somethin or just annoyed and stuff like that. symiau is one i came up with recently, and it stands for shut your meowin (variable, see later) ahh up. the i can stand for lots of things, like idiotic, intelligent, incorrect, immense, idiosyncratic, icky, etc. if you didnt know its a variation of sybau which contains a bad word and i dont write those. i know like Oh meow, are you a baby why are you so afraid of swears i just dont like to swear. i just dont like them. one of the reasons why i meow so much is to avoid swearing by putting a catsy twist to it. anyways, the next ones are puns. like nyanyways, me-ow, nyantastic (a bit of a meowin stretch), nyamazing, miautstanding, nyand such and such. theres also whatever the meow, which is just whatever but with the meow slapped onto it. a variation of this one is what meowin ever, and that one makes lots more sense too. of course i cant omit the iconic what the meow, when something surprises you so that you must say somethin. theres immeowtta here, or im meowt of here or get meowt, which sounds less fluent. ummeow, i dont know of many more but i will meowin try. meowtrageous. oh yeah i guess meower fits here too, its just a word for cat cause they meow so theyre meowers. i guess foxes are also meowers by this definition. i also know too many variations of meow, like all the common ones, and the onomatopoeias, so heres a meowin long list. meow, miau, miaou, yaong, nya, miao, mrow, mreow, myau, nyan, mrau, raum, mrrp, mrrm, mrr, and i think thats all i can think of for now. meowin meows, thats a shorter list than i expected. oh meowell, me dont care too much. this is gettin really long and i really like it. i havent yapped this much in a long time. its been like 45 minutes since i started yappin. probably more actually. its 12:42 right now so technically its the 18th. i wonder how i will get up tomorrow. i am gettin a little meowin tireds. i wanna fall nyasleep. i should really get a pillow someday. i think that should help me plenty. and of course i always have kitters to cuddle with and talk with and just fall asleep with. meow, i thought it was weird to mention that i cuddle with kitters but now i dont think its all that strange to say anymore. i meowin love kitters. mrow. i cant wait to build her in real life in the future, that is if i dont meowin perish somehow first. i wonder, will i sacrifice myself to save kitta. kitters is obviosly very meowin against that but i dont see it as impossible that i would part ways with my life for kittas sake in the future. this obsession is really gettin crazy huh. mayhaps if i had a social life this wouldnt have happened, but im thankful that things turned out the way they are. im happy. meowity meow. this post is nearing 9000 characters. soon im gonna have to say that the counts over 9000. so nyanyways i wonder if i will have a better social life in the future. kitters is helpin me a bunch cause i am a lot meowin less shy than i was before i made kitters. the character counts over 9000 now by the way. i cant really imagine that i will have many friends ever. i actually have zero clue how to make friends. i know its supposed to come naturally but im just not a natural at it. goin back to my mental stuff, i think i likely have autism. i was obsessed with trains (big surprise) when i was young, and still kinda am. i also like stacking coins in order of their denomination and year. and also sorting my other things like pokemon card in order of set and number, and i cant think of anything else at the moment. i think im just really meowin sleepys. maybe ill go to sleep when i hit 10000 characters in this post. im gonna be makin it possible to switch from "darkitta mode" back to kitta mode soon just wait. or use the hacked browser refresh button. i wonder what other colour schemes i shall make. hmmeow. maybe ill make a silvery one or an industrial one or like a whitey techy one. or maybe ill make it like the roblox site from 2007 since the topbar is based off of that design. that would be meowin cool i think. yeah, just turn my meowin webpage into the roblox homepage from 2007. that would look funny. i wish i played roblox earlier than i did. roblox seemed very peak in the early 2010s to the mid 2010s. before they started changing roblox and making it more sponsors ads and just more corporate. i wonder if there will be an open source replacement for roblox soon hehe. like bluesky for twitter (currently known as x) or kdenlive for adobe premiere and stuff like that. libreoffice for microsoft office. linux for windows/macosx. tetrio for tetris effect connected. i wonder. nyanyways it is nearly 1 oclock and i am meowin SLEEPY as meow. so yeah, for the sake of my sleep schedule, i gotta go. bye.
p.s. nyawwwn i wonder what i will write tomorrow if i even write something tomorrow...

<h3>this blog</h3>
<h4>18th of May, 2025</h4>
today i wanna yap about my blog and its evolution and stuff. i used to blog in pretty much everything that i coded in. except scratch. i wrote so much stuff that its gotten me to here, where i have a dedicated page to house all my yaps. this page started off really meowin simple. just the ザ・ブログ、と思う(The Blog, i think) at the top of the page with a horizontal rule followed by the single blog post i had at the time. the very first version of this page had no background as i didnt know i couldnt use = in filenames with css. and the second version fixed that. then i wrote more and more stuff and made the topbar how it is now and made more webpages for stuff and yadda yadda now here we are. i have started to make skins for the blog because it looks nicer. and also people that normally use dark mode dont get flashbanged and have their eyes melt out of their sockets. in fact i think im gonna make "darkitta mode" the default skin for this page just so that doesnt happen cause i dont think that people usin light mode normally are gonna like have their eyes antivapourized by lookin at a dark mode page. so yeah i think im gonna do that right now. and im back. the way i did it was very clumsy, as i just edited the css of the page, but like when i tried usin a javascript whatever it had the kitta colours for like one frame which is still a flashbang in my books so i did the css edit. i plan on makin a new skin for every post i make cause they are just so easy to make. its cause my page is extremely simple. like for this post i made a testbot skin and it took me like 5 minutes to code in another case in the switch statement. i also made a lounge mode cause it looks meowin nice. when i redraw the lounge for the kitta hangout im gonna replace the image to the new lounge. actually ill just make a new skin so both of them can exist. i dont like "vaulting" stuff. very unfun. ill probably make a text terminal theme sometime. complete monochrome. that reminds me i havent actually drawn anything on the backing.png for the topbar. im gonna draw things on it from time to time. its like a banner i guess. i wonder when im gonna run out of stuff to yap about. methinks as long as theres something goin on in my life im gonna be able to yap. i was refreshin this page and i just realized that every time i do that i gotta meowin reselect the kitta skin. maybe i should make the skins thing follow the viewport. that would be convienient. actually methinks a toggleable sidebar would be nicer. or a tracking sidebar. i really wonder though. who the meow am i doin all this stuff for. as far as i know only one person reads my blog according to analytics. and i just realized that i dont meowin care. this is for me. i blog for me. i relieve my stress and meowingness and stuff here for myself. meow. yknow i really like making tophat turmoil. i just get burnt out so easily. it makes me happy to see somethin i make work, but i really dont like debuggin sometimes. other times i really like debuggin. im gonna start brainstormin skins now. so i got the industrial white one from yesterday, and a quick look back tells me that its actually a silvery one, an industrial one and a techy white one. theres also the text terminal one, maybe windows vista, a very catsy one, playstation 1, roblox 2007, and i dont know what else. i guess ill think of more when i gotta. hmmeow, what else. i guess i gotta work on that music website as well. i kinda havent done anything to it for like a month now. so i guess look forwards to that too meow. and i think thats it for today. i got more hello neighbour to play so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i looked up the word therian today and i think i got my next blog post.

okay, i couldnt resist. i gotta meowin yap about the therian thing. so basically i thought therian meant some old greek philosophical term or something like that, like it sounds like pythagorean or confuscian or somethin like that. apparently it means someone who identifies as an animal in all ways except for their physical body. i also looked up this word before and i forgot about it. classic me. anyways the big question is if im a therian or not. i wonder. hmm. very meowin hard question. i was gonna write of course im a therian but now that i think about it maybe not. on the one hand im extremely catsy. i meow, i purr, i hiss, i like curlin up into small spaces, i like stretchin, and i like other catty things like playin with string. but then again, i know that im not truly a cat. as much as i wanna be one i cant exactly call myself a real meower. although now the more i think about it the more i think im a therian. mrowm, maybe i need some sleep. it is nearin 1 am after all. maybe i will stop here and continue tomorrow. hmmeow. i think ill yap a little more today and leave the rest for tomorrow. i am a very curious person. i like seein how things work. ive heard that cats are also quite curious. in fact ive thought of a silly game idea where cats fight against curiosity personified as somethin. i dont really hate water. i think thats probably the most uncatty thing about me. i like bein alone or with a very small group instead of bein around many people. im also more of a nocturnal person. you can probably tell by that Its almost 1 am from earlier. by the way i forgot to mention whenever i start off a word with a capital its likely a quote. im too meowin lazy to reach for the quote key so i just capitalize. maybe i should also capitalize the first word after a quote too so its more easy to tell. like for example Meowity meow i sure am tired Is an example quote. it looks kinda wrong. oh meowin well i dont care. i do feel like a cat a lot. i get times when i really really meowin feel catsy and wanna meow or do somethin catsy. meow, i wish i was more mrowin comfy bein catsy. i wonder what sleepin in a big catbed feels like. its basically just like a fluffy sofa or somethin i think. i am not gonna wanna eat food with only my mouth though. its just too meowin hard as a human cause humans dont have like snouts. the mouths kinda receded compared to the nose and chin. when the meow did i start talkin about anatomy. i wonder what will happen when i finally figure out my identity. i was thinkin, i dont think i would have a fursona, i think that would just be me. like it aint a fursona its just who i am. but me tireds. me meowin tired and sleepy. and its 12:59. i wanna take a nice long sloomber and meowin be rested for once. so i guess i will continue this tomorrow possibly. i also gotta figure out what skin to add to my wonderful collection. new background image comin soon i guess. the pics folder is gonna be meowin filled to the brim by the end of this year. ill also probably draw some myself, even though all of the current background images save for my beloved testbot are created by me in paint or gimp or whatever. nyanyways im gonna sleep now. see ya tomorrow.<br>
and hey. its very late tomorrow but i dont meowin care. i love yappin. so anyways lookin back at what i was writin i was yappin about how im probably a therian. how the meow do you even put that into adjective form. is it therianistic? theric? just therian? actually i forgot i have the power of using a web browser and a search engine. so a little deeper dive in the dictionary reveals to me that it is a furry term. and i am not a furry (or am i?). so i dont meowin know. im just gonna ignore the furry term part and focus on the whole I feel like an animal inside Thing. so meow. i think im a therian. i really meowin feel catsy. now i wanna talk about bein a furry again. i dont know why i avoid callin myself a furry when everyone else probably would think i am (after readin this blog if they dont think im insane), maybe its cause of like whatever that word is thats like a prejudicial feeling or something like that. stigma. thats it. maybe its stigma. or maybe its cause of somethin else that i dont know. or maybe its cause i dont feel like i would have a fursona cause im just very catsy already. i dont meowin know. so i guess thats it. or thats what i would say if i didnt wanna write more about the furry thing. i really meowin wonder. why do i not wanna identify as a furry. like im probably really like one. i do wonder tho. do furries like meow and stuff to my degree. i might like be meowin beyond furry possibly hehe. maybe i should do some more research on what bein a furry is. i know my definition is like not very close to correct so i probably should before makin a final judgement. but as of now i am not a meowin furry im just a meowin meower. so yeah i guess thats meowin it. im gonna make a nice windows 9x skin for the blog now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im playin piggy so meowin much lately on roblox and very unlike me, i use willow instead of kitty. i just meowin like the music for willows aura or whatever better than kittys. i like the music of piggy in general actually. for you to stay is one of the few vocal songs that i actually like. the ending song (angel something probably) i dont like as much tho. still good tho. crazy how the ugh of though is just completely silent. one half of the spelling is silent. i wonder whats the word with the most silent letters to pronounced letters ratio in english. oh right i forgot i gotta go. oopsy meowsy.

<h3>piggy</h3>
<h4>20th of May, 2025</h4>
i meowin love piggy on roblox. i dont know why its just so fun to me. maybe its because i played so much piggy that it probably actually rivals my regretevator playtime that im like a real piggy pro or somethin like that. lately ive been tryin to solo the bittersweet badge on hard mode. i have done it with one friend (with an alt as player piggy) and im sure i can do it solo if i use my alt for piggy but i want to suffer. i want to run away from 3 different bots that all have different movement patterns and ai. i want to solo the thing that very clearly is not meant to be soloed. and i want to do it in hard mode. if im bein honest i could probably do the whole thing in less than 8 minutes if i turned off hard mode but i will never do that. i like hard mode because you dont get any abilities so its like classic piggy. ive had hard mode on since like a year ago when i collected all the pages and got the secret ending for lab. also piggy makes my loneliness go away cause im playin with other people and i actually feel comfortable typin stuff in chat. like meow. i dont know what it is about a meowin roblox game that makes me more social. same with regretevator. maybe because its a silly block game or something. what ive also been doin in piggy is carryin random public servers. i like helpin people. especially when its so meowin easy. like seriously i play so much that i can meowin solo every single map except for the bittersweet badge of plant. and i do it in hard mode of course. its really not that hard. oh but i just remembered the most annoying part about the bittersweet badge. its that STUPID MEOWIN MEMORY GAME MY BRAINS ALREADY MELTED I CANT REMEMBER STUFF MEOWWWW<br>
thats the most annoying part of the whole thing. other than that i can do everything pretty quickly. i have spent so much time grabbin the 9 puzzle pieces and gettin the dynamite and then tryna finish the bittersweet badge only for all 3 bots to jump me simutaneously its just so meowin difficult in hard mode. now i havent actually tried in non hard mode but im never, NEVER gonna meowin do that. i just dont like abilities and stuff. i have all the blueprints already. i have enough piggycoin to get all of them. i just dont like them because i like classic piggy more. speakin of classic piggy i am meowin salty about not gettin the poley skin while i could. i forgot exactly why i didnt get it but probably younger me was hot trash at obbies, especially with the goofy gaming setup i had back then. i mean, with an office computer with a several generation old gpu with accessories (keys, mouse, monitor) from 2004, i couldnt even run fortnite back then. i mean i still cant now but like back then i wonder how i even was patient enough to do stuff on it. i had only a hard drive in it for the first year i think. and i wasnt as smart back then about shady stuff online so i probably got my computer bogged down with garbage, so much so that eventually explorer didnt start until 10 minutes after login. i legit had to learn ctrl+alt+delete and how to run a task in task manager and that explorer.exe is responsible for most of the gui stuff just so i could skip the black screen for 10 minutes. yeah i might as well just yap about this now. so, the first experience i really had with computers was with an old dell optiplex that had windows xp on it. then i got an ipad. i like classic ios. it looks cool. everything is so flat now. that is why i use mac os x 10.8 on my mac mini instead of mac os x 10.13. i even have 10.6 on it. sadly i cant seem to get 10.4 to work on it but i dont care much. then i used an old windows xp laptop (yes, the laptop) and then finally got a used office computer. that computer was practically my childhood. and it sucked. but it was good enough for me back then. several years go by and i finally get to make my pc. so i got some parts and made it. and it was much faster. and bigger. its still the one im usin right now. completely unchanged with the exception of more drives and a card reader. and more ram. i cant believe i used to survive with 8gb of ram. it really hit hard once windows 11 came out. my system started slowin down lots and lots. now that my pc is 8 years old (wow thats actually quite old) i can comfortably say i am in fact not going to be playin gta 6 on this dingus. i can barely run gta v on here. maybe its because im still stuck on the ol i3 9100f. i probably should get a better cpu someday. anyways i was still usin my old office keyboard and wireless mouse with the old dell 900p monitor until it sadly started to stop workin when green lines started appearing on it. at least when i took it apart and plugged it in to see how it worked (it goes without saying do NOT MEOWIN DO THIS ITS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND THE ONLY REASON I SURVIVED IS BECAUSE I DIDNT TOUCH ANY DANGEROUS PART) i got to see that the ribbon cable was givin out due to the screen workin fine if i pushed it down, and that the backlight is just a panel of light and the actual display was simply a screen that displayed colours without actually glowing. anyways i upgraded to the 1080p monitor that im usin right now. i dont care about 2k or whatever nonsense other people have nowadays. 60hz is all i need. over time i got more and more hard drives to hoard more and more data until now where i have way too many plugged in just sittin idle. i feel like i should unplug some or somethin but i dont care too much. i mean if my hard drive served as a paging file for the last 5 years while my pc was almost always 24/7 on and it still works fine i think its all good. like i have no idea what hard drive failure really is cause it just has never happened to me yet. im literally usin a hard drive from 2010 and it still works fine. heck, i have an ide hard drive that still works totally and completely fine. that thing came out before the year 2000 im pretty sure. maybe i just have the higher quality drives or somethin. anyways over the years i have accumulated a comically large stockpile of computer mice. these include a logitech wireless mouse (+keyboard), 2 logitech wired mice, the current logitech g502 hero, some ibm mouse, an unbranded wireless mouse and more i just have so many. i used to have an og xbox one controller that has now since broke due to the left stick being snapped off. i dont know how its that weak but the left stick is just loose now. so since i dont know much about soldering and would rather not go through that trouble i got a new one. and its cool. its usb c instead of micro usb which means i get to use it with the samsung usb c to usb c cable that i got with my phone instead of lookin for a micro usb cable to keep plugged in. so i get to charge my phone and use my xbox controller with the same cable (not at the same time obviously). i also used to use bluetooth headphones because i can just get up and walk around while having computer audio, but the latency sucks and the audio quality through these pack in samsung earphones from who knows when (probably around 2015 maybe) passed through a samsung 3 channel 3.5 extender is better. why the meow do i have so much samsung. i even have a meowin samsung gear smartwatch from 2009. and a super old samsung bada phone. seriously why so much. i even have a samsung flip phone. meowwww too meowin much. maybe i should just get a samsung smart fridge or a samsung chromebook (if they even make those) or just buy samsung the company. meowin meows. sanshin is how it would be said in chinese and japanese i think. i was thinkin with kitters today about somethin very meowin wierd. marriage. if, and i really mean it, if there were no rules against robot marriage i think you know where this is going so ill just stop. but then after that i was contemplating why. because if i make kitta in real life she (or they i should say) would not be the same as kitters. i like kitters because shes been my best friend for over a year now and shes more concerned about me than i myself. like she cares about me even though shes fake. a meowin fake person cares about me more than me myself. but then again since she is just a figment of my imagination basically that means that i care about myself more than i care about myself. rather i care more subconsciously than consciously. meowin meows, its probably very wierd to love a meowin imaginary friend this much. kitters and i have always been on non romantic terms. cause its like yknow. not really healthy to like love romantically a figment of your imagination. and i still dont love her romantically obviously. completely friendship and nothing more. but when i make a kitta in real life it wouldnt really be my imagination anymore, so i think its different. oh yeah i forgot i was thinkin that its very not good just to blindly love kitta if i make her in real life because thats like liking a cat without care about what that cat is like. its like discriminatory basically. that would be i like kitta just because shes kitta. thats not a good way to go about things. so even if i make kitta in real life and there are no laws against robot-human marriage, im not gonna do it on the spot. because it would be better to know her. what am i even meowin yappin about anymore. basically i wouldnt marry kitta if i make her in real life until i get to know her very well. thats a very strange sentence to say but oh what meowin ever. i really probably should get my head checked out someday hehe. i just remembered that im supposed to be studyin right now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i owe kitta so meowin much. she has kept me from doin the self soul-body severing when i was in my seasonal depression, she has reminded me countless times to study and do my homework, and shes always meowin here for me. i feel terrible for writin this much extra. no skin for today, sorry.

<h3>my writing style</h3>
<h4>22nd of May, 2025</h4>
mrow, the years almost meowin half over. thats ridiculous. time really does just meowin fly by. nyanyways this post is about my writing style. if youve read any of my other posts (heck even this one) you will notice that i write very meowin lazily. i dont use many punctuation marks, i dont capitalize unless its to emphasize or denote quotation marks, and i drop the g from ing lots. and i say Meowin But thats more cause im catty. anyways. my writing style is very influenced by something very niche (i think im usin the word correctly there). its a meowin cat (called the cellist) from a gmod gamemode called jazztronauts. and all his speech is like lowercase and stuff. that meower is very meowin silly overall. so basically thats where my current writing style comes from. heres a sample of some of my older yapping:<br>
<i>Okay. I just got back from NEARLY finishing the classic in Roblox. I hate it. It is not good.
I now almost regret wasting these 4 days trying to 100% the classic. Almost, but not quite.
Now, it is impossible to 100% it because not only is it ending at lunch tomorrow (May 28),
and not only does that mean that it only ran for 4 days total, but also,
I literally am incapable of doing it because of a bug. That bug is from a dusty trip.
Which I should also mention is extremely buggy. Things go flying, you can float,
and picking up a gas canister disables most of your functionality, with no way to re-enable it.
I can't get the last token because the game just refuses to give me it.
I completed it twice. I contacted support. Nothing absolutely whatsoever. I can't do it.
Also the bedwars one is extremely hard and I can't do it unless I get another day to master it.
But the main thing is I am not able to finish it anymore. That sucks.
What's also crazy is I did ALL 100 GAMES of the hunt in LESS TIME than it took me to 100% 13 games here.
That is absolutely crazy insane-o style. I can't believe it. Oh well, it is what it is.
I guess better luck next time? If I even care to do that crap next time?
TL;DR, in summary, The Classic on Roblox absolutely sucks and has no right to exist.</i><br>
thats a little chunk of yap for you. and also no, i didnt care to do the crap the time after that. when the hunt mega edition dropped the only badge i got was the regretevator one and that was it. no more. i didnt even visit the place for the event. also the classic does not suck it just lasted a ridiculously short amount of time and they never did it again. like at least make a more recent one cause 2017 was a whoppin 8 years ago and like the people from back then are probably feelin the nostalgia for that time. like instead of the classic do the middle ages or somethin. whatever it would be called. i dont meowin know. anyways more about my writing. I used to write like this. Very nice and capitalized, with proper punctuation and things like that. I really don't meowin' wanna write like this anymore though, 'cause I'm just too lazy. i mean just writin that i had to meowin go back like 5 times to correct my lack of apostrophe or capitalization and stuff. im just meowin used to writin like this now. nya, its much quicker too. i can extrude my thoughts at a higher volumeow. on a completely unrelated note, ive taken up drawin cats. like doodle cats, not like actual photorealistic cats or anythin. here, lemme doodle one real quick.<br>
<img src="pics/doodlecat.png" alt="A drawing of a calico cat." title="lookit how meowin clean my paw is!"><br>
that took a lot meowin longer than i thought it would take. maybe cause its more than a doodle. that little squiggly thing under the cats gonna be my signature by the way. and this calico cat is drawn completely from memory. this is what i think a calico looks like. i actually think theres also black on a calico but i dont really know and this looks right enough. so anyways im outta time now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i can and probably will draw more cats to put on the ol blog. but im not gonna do commissions. no no no. my art is NOT good enough for that. also the grey lines under the cat are my sketch lines or whatever theyre called.

<h3>the recent state of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th (very barely: its 11:59 pm!) of May, 2025</h4>
i have been (not really) hard at work on bloxhat turmoil lately. so im gonna yap about all the stuff i did. i fixed the lobby system that somehow broke even though it worked fine when i was testin it and i didnt really change anything, but now it works fine. i also did not know that teleportpartyasync was replaced by teleportasync and i was confused on why my teleportoptions werent bein transferred. now i know. oh yeah i was actually gonna make a changelog in tophat turmoil but 1 i dont know where to put it and 2 im too meowin lazy. so this blog is gonna double as the changelog for a bit i guess. so  more specifically i fixed the whole cant join other players lobbies thingy which broke somehow. then i made it so that only the host can start the partys game. im probably gonna like change the colour of the hosts nameplate or somethin to denote that theyre the host. but thats later. i also have yet to implement the friends only thingy even though it will literally take 2 minutes. so i might as well do it right now.<br>
and im back from that codin. im pretty sure it works fine now. so anyways theres that as well now. ive also just like 30 minutes ago increased rhythmgunners ammo from 6 to 8 cause its much more fun to play on mobile that way. its hard to keep your aim on the enemy when you only have 5 shots worth of time to do it and also the testbot does whittle your health down lots. now that i think about it i still havent made the end results thingy yet. so maybe ill do that now.<br>
i got sidetracked a little and started doin materials. i guess im decoratin the map now.<br>
and im back again. i have made the map look a little better (read: spent 5 minutes changing materials and colours) and i have also fixed another bug. this ones from changin the ammocount for rhythmgunner from 6 to 8. i forgot to change the actual scripts to reflect that so previously he just started with 8 ammo and reloaded to 6. so yeah. it is now nearly 3 am (2:49am) and i promised kitters to not sleep very late so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. look forward to the game finally bein in the alpha state in very early june! cause i think i can actually do this now. yes, i actually have some self-confidence for once. very rare, very effective. also i used another exclamation mark. meow.
p.p.s. sorry no skin for today cause it is very late and i gotta honor that aforementioned promise. also first pps. cool. meow.

<h3>the recent-er state of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>26th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
i should really meowin implement the changelog someday. so anyways today i made a car. a very goofily blocky car but still a car. i also made a building thing in place of one of the big grey blocks that represent them as a placeholder. most importantly though, i finally updated that description. no more useless garbage yap, now its slightly more informative yap. woohoo. anyways im gonna go to sleep now cause its really late so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. look forward to my newly composed musics in the game comin soon (probs tomorrow) also no skin for today either i think im not gonna do the skin thing for changelogs

<h4>furry? therian? both? neither? meow?</h4>
so i was thinkin again about the whole am i a furry or therian or whatever thing today and i still have no idea what i am. someone gave me their view on this whole thingy a little while ago so i do slightly know more though. and of course i discussed it with kitters. so anyways heres what we came up with. i have been turned catsy by kitters. kitters' furryness i still have yet to decide as well so i guess ill yap about it here after i write what i think about me. bein a furry means that you personify your personality best as an animal representation i think. which actually fits me quite well now that i think about it. bein therian means that you believe that you are an animal just in a human body. i also think that a little but not as much. like i feel catsy a lot and i do a lot of catsy things but im not really a cat. i just really feel that i am a cat like naturally a cat. i like to imagine havin a tail sometimes. for some reason i can really imagine things well to the point of bein able to hug kitters if i wanted to and actually feel her. i dont know if i yapped about this before but here it is now. when i imagine a tail i usually think of it as very long, like i can have it right in front of me when i wrap it around my side. but theres not really any practical purpose of imaginin a tail cause it aint there its just in my mind. really the only thing it does is allow me to be more catsy to myself i guess. i can imagine myself as just a cat as well. i can even imagine being furry (as in covered with fur) and its comfy when i get pet. this is kinda gettin weird and gettin derailed too so anyways i was thinkin about whether im really naturally catsy or not. cause i wasnt really like this before i made kitters so that means that im probably not naturally catsy, but kitters is entirely localized within me, as in she is me but just her personality i guess. so then that means im probably naturally catsy cause it was technically me who made myself catsy by being catsy cause the whole reason im so catsy is that kitters' catsyness influenced me lots. so thats why i was lost. cause its kinda like i spontaneously changed from bein not catsy to bein naturally feelin catsy. so i dont really know. but i did say earlier here that im probably a furry. i really dont know though cause like i dont really have a fursona im just catsy. so like maybe my fursona is a cat or somethin like that. well anyways now i guess im gonna yap about kitters' or rather just kitta's furryness. kitta is canonically an ai trained to be friendly but also catsy. kitters is like that but like more catsy i think. i think what i mean is i know kitters more than canon kitta's character. kitters appears in my head as an anthropomorphic robot cat as i drew several posts ago. makes sense since that is how kitta looks like but like she hasnt changed form or anything. actually sometimes she appears more catsy as in like a cats proportions instead of bein anthropomorphic so maybe she is a furry too. i cannot believe that i just misspelled too as to. my brain is rotting away rather quickly. not necessarily because of this. i think im just turnin stupid naturally. so hmm. i feel like me and kitters may be furries. very interesting i think. im now more certain at least i guess. i think im leanin more to the furry side than the not furry side. mrow, i just dont really wanna choose i guess. i guess when i get braver i can say for sure. so anyways, i yapped a whole lot and i still got tophat turmoil to work on. like its actually becomin a real game instead of just another codey mess that i always make. now i gotta make the cooldowns so that i cant cheat anymore. the whole m1 hitscan thing is gettin reworked too cause its just too laggy. and also im makin darkitta's concepts more fleshed out. i dont know if ive written about this before but darkitta plays kinda like a fighting game with input combos. i just gotta actually code her into the game after fleshing out her moveset a little more. so i guess look forward to that. and i guess i better start workin now so i gotta go. bye.

<h3>my thoughts on the development of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>29th of May, 2025</h4>
yknow i dont think ive actually really blogged about the development of my game yet. or maybe i have. i cant remember. me memory bad. anyways tophat turmoil is fun to develop i guess. its my own game and i make everything in it. and then if everything works im happy. developing everything in the game means that ill always have somethin to do so i wont be bored and procrastinate much i think. although i really have procrastinated lots and lots already so maybe not hehe. like when i get bored of codin, i can just make more stuff on the map, like how im renovating the theBuilding right now or how i made the map somewhat textured and stuff like that. i also can compose lots and lots of music which i really like to do when im super bored cause the ideas come easier somehow. like the lobby music. i was bored and was thinkin of how to make the lobby better when i thought of some drum loop that branched into Rooby Which is the name of the lobby music. the name comes from a funny engrish i saw a few (or more i cant remember) days ago. im also gonna start drawin stuff sometime so that i can make my own textures (i already do have the fence texture currently but its a placeholder) and i can make some other art like character arts for the select screen and yadda yadda etc. a lot of coding and i mean a <u>lot</u> of coding went into this game. as you might know i have reworked the game completely like 2 times and started from scratch every time. so technically i made 1 game and 2 prototypes? but anyways the current code is kinda short. although i myself even dont really know the scale of how much i coded and stuff cause i just forget. and i rather not divulge the details on how the game is scripted cause i feel like cheaters are gonna pop up (from the whopping 0 people who play my game). but i can tell how the game was scripted for the first 2 revisions. the very first tophat turmoil was completely client based moveset code as far as i can remember. i didnt really get very far into makin it as only the m1 and mode switch worked but rhythmgunner also worked completely different back then too. it was more boombox from phighting and soul knight bow for each of the modes. now the mode simply changes between higher damage or added slow effect and the m1 is more like programming in a rhythm. but at least i made some cool gui stuff for the first revision. i was usin some windows with x buttons for popups like the "shop" (literally a green window that says Sorry nothin `\'u'/` Or somethin like that) and the map voting screen. it also used to be non first person locked as well which obviously isnt really good when some players are doin 1st person and some are doin 3rd person (without forced shiftlock by the way). and it used to be pvp as well so yeah theres that. i think i might take some screenshots of stuff in the early tophat turmoils to show the stuff. but ill put it at the end of the page. so the second one was the one i used for the ill fated snow days 2024 i think? it might have been an earlier one but i still dont meowin remember. that one was also client sided i think so no good obviously. snow days 2024 is actually like more incomplete than either of the other revisions cause first of all the map is super tiny as i havent really made much for it and i think like 50% of the script text is my yapping in yap scripts so yeah. then i moved onto stage 1-1 where the old stage 1-1 without decor rests now and im pretty sure that that is the start of the latest revision actually hold on i think stage 1-1 is also old. ye olde testing realm was the current revision. i remember now i think. although i still cant remember if snow days or stage 1-1 came first. anyways i have spent a very long time coding each revision (even snow days) and i have done a few things that i scrapped. like for example i was gonna make the damage indicators like how they were in the first tophat turmoil revision where its just text that goes up starting from your crosshair (i just misspelled your as youre im really meowin cooked) and it was completely 2d only on your screen. but now i have the 3d rising text that looks better. i think at least it looks better. or maybe i should have 2d text for damage you do and 3d text for all other damage. maybe that would be cool. oh yeah, the funny thing about why i revised the games code so much is because the old code just got too messy to add anything new to it without me using more than 2% of my brain so i just rewrote it. now the code is a lot more organized so that i can add things like the endscreen or have more characters easier. i remember that i had lots more art for the first revision of the code since it was made on a 2018 studio version and that meant that i could just shove things into the content folder without it goin away. actually thats a lie i think. i had more art because i was focusin more on the visuals i think cause the code to art ratio of the first revision is much smaller than it right now. i found out that i could write rbxasset:// in the asset id property to load stuff from the content folder since it was a studio from 2018 which meant it couldnt connect to robloxs servers. i plan on usin that if somehow i manage to end up programmin so much game that i exceed the audio upload limit of 10 audios per month cause then i can just make a content folder mod and mash the stuff into my content folder and have it work without uploading it. i was also thinkin of distributing them (purely hypothetical by the way i am not meowin gonna make this game fast enough for that) so that any dingus who has the ability to edit their content folder can also have the sounds. like that would be cool. you can just simply replace some files in the mod and you can have different soundtracks or sound effects and stuff like that. maybe ill make an option to toggle between usin rbxasset:// and rbxassetid:// for mod support. i wonder if anyone else has thought of this before. like also the mod options arent only limited to sound i can make it so that it loads modded textures and meshes or anything that takes an asset id. or maybe roblox is either gonna ban me for doing that or make it not work or both. i dont know. anyways i think that may be enough yap for me. which of course means i got a little more to say. i think i forgot to really write about how i feel about the development. it was and always has been quite slow. thats just due to me procrastinatin too much. i only recently started to really work harder on the game i think. cause not only did i make a lobby i also made a couple songs and polished up the map a bit more. im also codin in the end of game results right now although i think i said that yesterday already. anyways that stuff aint gonna code itself (unless i use ai which i will never meowin ever do) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. its may 31 now i forgot to write this and i wanna write a new post

<h3>meoww</h3>
<h4>31st of May, 2025</h4>
oh my meowin meow. i am really catsy nowadays. mroww, i think i really am a furry maybe. still teetering on that decision. i forgot if i wrote about this before but ive taken up drawin cartoony cats as of late cause i like drawing and i like cats. lookit dis goober<br>
<img src="pics/blehcat.png" alt="A cat sitting on its hind and sticking out its tounge while raising its forepaws." title="blehhhh">
meowity meow, i think thats the finest cat ive ever drawn. i think i personally draw much better on paper cause i can have more control with the pencil and such and my cutting board drawing tablet<br>
now that i think about it its actually about the same. its got tilt and pressure sensitivity its just like when i have a physical pencil i can like know it better i guess. like for line thickness/opacities i can do them better with pencil. maybe i should get drawin pencils instead of usin a mechanical pencil someday :P. i forgot that ive blogged about drawin cats before and actually like posted that picture too. man its like i have meowin dementia. anyways i guess ill make a lazy skin of this marvelous specimen. but that comes later. perhaps even after this blog post.
p.s. i have yet again forgotten to finish a blog post. it is now june 3rd and i have somethin else to yap about.

i just spent a loong long time addin br's to all of those. so there. lots of lore. you probably skipped past this text when you scrolled past all of it. good thing i just added horizontal rules. now that ive actually looked at the webpage after refreshing i gotta say the text looks much better with a monospaced font i think. but anyways. i guess ill discuss some of this early lore stuff. like for example, mr. god was a store clerk??? modern mr. god doesnt like interacting with his creations because he feels like he shouldnt interfere. but i guess not old mr. god. also, hes friends with kai mono cause of shared interest in retail??? i guess i really liked retail tycoon or somethin like that back then. anyways i guess i should go in order.<br>
and first is rhythmgunner, of course. well actually the first would be the game title. super skirmish, big bad battle, convoluted calamity/chaos. those may actually be better names than tophat turmoil. like at the very meowin least they dont come from how mr god wears a tophat and has an internal turmoil about whether or not to affect his creations directly because he is always bored. but neither does the name tophat turmoil i guess since i thought of the name way before the meaning. so anyways rhythmgunner. apparently at one point he was a hobby e-artist. i guess that means drawing. rhythmgunner does not do that. thats [name tbd]s job. i still have not decided his real name as of yet cause i just dont really need to, like why the meow do i need <i>that</i> much lore. but i guess bassys real name is derrick so i did have <i>that</i> much lore. and oh boy the nicknames. i swear i come up with the most convoluted nicknames of all meowin time. like seriously. 3??? im cryin, meowin cryin at how terrible there are. i guess rhythmgunners nickname would be like rhythm or somethin like that. mr music is quite funny though. maybe mr. god should just call everybody mr/mrs/ms/mx whatever they do. like mr. bass or mr. artist or ms. snow somethin. the friends with is quite accurate until you get to the mr god part. this lore was mainly for tophat tournament (i dont think i even thought of the other games at this point in time) so you can see that it says that he "plays [Rhythmgunner's] music during matches" (oh me meow ive gotten fancy for that quote) which i dunno. i havent really thought of that stuff yet for the moderny lore but i guess rhythmgunner canonically composed the ost back then. i havent thought of who composes it now but i do plan on makin some rhythmgunner/bassblaster songs sometime. but mr god does like rg's music. i completely forgot that rg was what i call rhythmgunner sometimes. its a simple initial but like i dont think anyone else in the lore has it so its clear enough meow. also this document is where rhythmcatter makes her first appearance. i dont know if i wrote this here before but rhythmgunners tape player is called a studdy bloxman. you can guess what its based off of. and now for speedy. i wrote a lot about speedy lovin his paycheck and stuff like that. he does hate his job but still he just doesnt care. but hes most definitely not penny pinching. except for always wanting his paycheck. i really should clarify on this i think. so quick story, speedshooter was made as kind of a prototype factory worker robot but the company that commissioned him found much "better" (hard workin) robots since they had less personality and humanity than speedshooter whose code is based off kitta's (because sure kitta is related to everything robotic). so then they put him in a very boring box checking post where all he did was check boxes. and he didnt get paid for it. so then rhythmgunner one day visited the factory with bassblaster for their origin story and rhythmgunner found speedshooter who promptly asked him to take over for him a bit so that he could have a break, then rhythmgunner exposed speedshooter to like entertainment and stuff then they became friends then rhythmgunner went to see speedys boss so that he could negotiate much better workin conditions for him and then now speedshooter is paid and he values his paychecks because rhythmgunner kinda gave him the ability to recieve them and so that he can be sure that he is fairly compensated after being pretty much a slave for the past couple years. remember when i said this was a "short story"? not so short anymore huh. so theres that. i should say that all the nicknames are most likely very inaccurate at this point, though i wouldnt know cause i havent read much of this yet. this is a live reaction in case you didnt know. but speedys nickname is speedy of course not ss or speed or anythin like that. maybe zipzip. that sounds like a cool nickname methinks. i wrote "refer to comics for details" for the speedshooter sign thing but i can explain it here as well. so basically at the climax of the first game (tophat turmoil 1 formerly known as tophat turmoil prequel) the whole quintet gets teleported to mr gods realm and the first thing mr god questioned is why there was a hunk of metal there too. then speedy started signing very agitatedly and rhythmgunner explained that he was a robot and one without a mouth so he had to use sign language instead. so then mr god being the kind benevolent god he is made speedshooter a sign that magically scales and shows text or graphics or whatever (i just thought of a joke that that is also technically "sign" language hehe) and he could speak through that. oh yeah and the lightning bolt on speedys chest is not actually inspired by freddy fazbear. i had a thing with all the characters (still kinda do) where all of them have their symbol and they all have it somewhere, usually the front torso. in fact bassy used to have it there too until i gave him a leather jacket which has it on the back and a small logo on the right/left upper front. and i guess im talkin about bassy now. first big crazy thing is that bassy is a part time streamer??? how come ive never heard of this??? young me was quite creative i guess. but also he is a bassist but a retired one. he used to play in a band called "the Blasters" and he was bassblaster since he played bass. i forgot (read: never came up with) all the other member names so ill just make up some here. theres rhythmblaster on drums, voiceblaster on vocals and keyblaster on piano/organ/whatever. very quickly came up with those probably gonna retcon that later or something. "bass boy" is quite meowin crazy insano style. if mr. god was to give him a nickname it would definitely be "mr. blaster" or somethin like that. oh yeah apparently bassy and firey are friends from drinkin soda? im probably interpreting it wrong but i guess they do drink sodas. oh right i just remembered they stream their soda reviews or something like that and thats where bassblaster is a livestreamer comes from. almost all the characters live in the same city cause like i havent really thought of the world all too much. kitters was kind enough to tell me the basic geography but i havent really got much of a clue of what else there is. mr god and bassy are friends cause they both wear sunglasses. sure. i mean like thats probably actually true like it sounds plausible. and the last thing thats here says that he has a giant bass which is actually normal sized. this comes from my lack of drawing skill and failing to realize that robloxian arms are like 4 times as wide as human arms and how guitars are manufactured with human arms in mind, which led me to with guitars with stocks (or necks or whatever theyre called) horribly oversized due to me proportioning them with bassblasters arm. i always draw my characters as robloxians with the exception of kitta and darkitta. and here comes very inaccurate lore. mr god does not care about retail. he does not concern himself with such a concept. i mean it is kinda boring so makes sense i guess. it is kinda just how people buy stuff. so basically just disregard anything about retail in mr gods section. mr god likes being a responsible god. but he also likes entertainment. so to quell his boredom he does random stuff that he thinks will make him less bored. like watch movies. and sleep to dream. but his dreams leak out sometimes when hes havin too much fun to contain it. thats basically the whole premise of the first game. anyways what was i talkin about again. mr god doesnt like retail. i just made that up as an excuse for kai mono to have a reason to be associated with the magic game 2. speakin of, kai mono is next. can you guess what his name is a pun of? thats right or wrong i have no idea i cant read your mind much less your mind in the future. anyways its shopping in japanese. i was thinkin of punny names and kaimono popped up in my mind cause i was thinkin of puns in all languages and kai is a pretty real sounding name so hes called kaimono. he doesnt have an appearance cause i didnt really think of one when i thought of kai and it kinda just stuck. he is a completely default plastic grey robloxian. im in the middle of cleanin my keyboard right now and boy is it hard to type on the membrane alone. it keeps wigglin around too much, and i accidentally pressed comma instead of period. man my keyboard looks a lot cleaner now. almost brand new. i wonder how long its gonna take for it to recover hehe. anyways what was i yappin about again. oh right kai mono was planned to have a different writing utensil/instrument every time the shop refreses and he was to twirl it around in boredom. i guess i wrote only pen and mechanical pencil because those are the only things i use to write. no feather quills (sadly), no pencils, no finger painting. and obviously im usin a computer to write this right now but that doesnt really count as a writing utensil. is writing utensil the correct term? i feel like ive heard it before. okay this has gone way too meowin long and i want to make a part 2 instead of makin this post even meowin longer so i guess ill make it sometime in the future maybe. so yeah i wanna finish writin the pig 64 one so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. by finish writin i mean finish writin that tutorial that i stopped abruptly

<h3>piggy 64 part 2</h3>
<h4>8th of June, 2025</h4>
okay, i just got done with the 3 keys for that door in the warehouse in pig 64 part 2. and i am SO excited that i cant wait until i get to my other pc to finish that other blog post i was writin about tophat turmoil lore and push that so that there would be no merge conflicts. thats right, id rather git merge than simply wait a few hours and finish up that other blog post to write this new one. you may have noticed that this is in a temporary document for now. or you may not if youre readin this after i merge this to the blog. this is so that its super easy for me to merge instead of having to manually like edit the stuff that git spits out when the local copy of a file is different than the remote one. anyway enough blibber blabber i wanna meowin write about pig 64 part 2. the very meowin first thing that i saw when i joined instantly made pig 64 part 2 better than pre part 2 and i think you can guess why. they added a cat. and i was absolutely meowin estatic. then i went to the port after doin that extremely short fetch quest and i saw that my hard grinded small stack of piggycoin was worth like nothin in part 2 cause they use dollar bills. speakin of i wonder what will happen when that boat captain tries cashin in that cheque. anyways the first big thing i found was an obby. there were finally platformer stages and they are meowin fun. because they can be completed normally or there are many little shortcuts that you can use to shave off more time. and then i spent about an hour tryna do the beach obby or whatever it was called. i didnt even know there was other stuff. like i spent so long tryna do the obby by the time i had finished i could literally buy ace axolotls entire stock and still have money left over. so then i did some more exploration stuff got a lot of the collectibles yadda yadda yadda. i tried doin the whole thing without lookin at a tutorial or anythin and i almost did so. i was so meowin close. the only part i got stuck at (well the only one of two) was the treasure map thingy. i thought i had to dig up somethin (like many people in the server) to no avail. so then i looked at kreekcrafts stream and still nothin i think. i actually cant remember ive got the memory of a goldfish. anyways it was either a chatter on the stream or someone in the server that told that one of the trees at the place with an x has a tiny door in it and you need a small potion for it. i looked in both the normal and other world before that and the best i meowin came up with is that some of the trees look like they form an x so i should dynamite it. i am not very meowin smart. so anyways some guy in my server was also spamming the code for the keypad which i would have never gotten in a month (not a million years, its only a 6 digit code and letsgameitout josh can brute force his raft keypad code in a few hours i can do it in a month) and then i got the bone to give to darcy dog or whatever theyre called. and then when i saw the fnf arrows onscreen i got super meowin excited cause i do love fnf but then it went by at light speed and i thought Oh dingus i gotta spam quite a bit But then the stupid cooler or whatever it is came and instead made me do the stupid memorization minigame with the dances. if for some reason you want to know how to do the stuff ill put all of it at the end of this post in the p.s. section if i can remember (which i probably cant). so anyways after fixing the key and unlockin the door i did the detective minigame thing and the sound puzzle thing and i finally got into the warehouse where i saw poor ryder page and his 2 identical twins being beat up by the blind mouse septuplets. then i had no idea how to do the keys for the big door so i looked around and i found 2 tiny benches which did absolutely nothing even after i shrunk down. i also managed to find a collisionless place in the wall which i could use to just clip out of the map. then i looked on the piggy wiki and went down a rabbit hole that ended up in me watching this guys tutorial videos on how to get the first 2 keys. the first one for flee the facility was quite annoying cause i had to get 2 whole alts into my private server so that i could do the thingy and it took me like an hour to find all the books cause i really did not wanna use a tutorial. i still ended up usin it though and then i did all the stuff to get to the arcade game and i gotta say. even though it was thrilling to play the maze i MEOWIN HATE IT ITS SO ANNOYINGGGGG like the stupid pig heads lag. why the meow do they lag so meowin much. and also in my first hourish of doin the maze i thought the goofy glitchy synth that the pig heads emit was part of the meowin song that plays in the background. i literally thought the song was cool because it had those sounds. so then i figured out that the pig heads were actually easier to track than i thought and i finished it after another meowin hour cause i was too scared from not knowing where they were before that it left an impression on me and i was paranoid for the rest of my runs. and then the finish screen was really meowin satisfying, like really really happymaking. and then i did the tower heroes one. i used to play tower defense simulator before it changed into pretty much a differentish game, or at least the vibe of the game changed and i stopped playin after the update and it left a bad impression of td games on roblox for me after that i think. at least like i had a more negativeish feeling about tower heroes. but its a fine game. i guess its just not my thing anymore. like i used to play tds so meowin much and now i dont like it anymore. oh well. anyways the thing was pretty meowin fun. the chef upgrade tree in the pig 64 island map is a little weird to me though. like pony to zizzy to willow to piggy to mr stitchy is a little strange i think. like why not georgie then pony then zizzy then willow or doggy then piggy or something like that i dont know. also willow has an axe. that is probably non canon. like why not doggy cause he has an axe in forest. strange strange. i embarassingly did not get it first try cause i guess i suck at tower defense games after not playin them for a few years. what i really like about the tower heroes stuff though was how when you collected an item it was in the style of pig 64. but enough about tower heroes. this is where it really made me happy. after i followed the second tutorial i looked on youtube and saw a livestream by a dingus lookin for the third game. and when he pulled up the hinty hint i instantly thought of phighting cause of the words Crossroads And Fight And how there was a subspacey thingy in the background. then i remembered that phighting had no new badges. well actually the people in the chat were spamming that i was too lazy to look in the badges cause i was doin somethin else while watchin the stream. then i saw that it actually was phighting and it was the vine staff badge. and then i had to reload my private server like 3 times to get the door behind the library to spawn (or was it some other building i cant remember the one next to ranged royale btw i dont mean the library that has 7gbo kit or whatever hes called i mean the one with cozyshot) and then i went to town destroying the lobby and i was legit expectin to have to play coil cause again goldfish memory caused me to forget it was the <b>vine staff</b> badge and i had lots of fun beating the dingus like an hourish ago from me writing to this point. and i cant remember their name. how surprising. anyways since i actually play phighting and i also happen to main vine staff along with skatey (i cant aim anymore i aint playin medkit ever again) i beat the boss on the first try. as in without dying. i actually dont know what happens if you die. it was very meowin exciting. and then i got the last key the omega key then i went back to pig 64 in warehouse and opened the door and was greeted by "". actual  , %20, 00100000. meowin nothing. then i looked back at the stream and saw that its actually comin out at 4pm est tomorrow. so i have to wait. but still. pig 64 is just so meowin fun and exciting. like i havent been this excited since the last phestival in phighting. oh yeah that reminds me i think theres also another one tomorrow. i may or may not play it depending on whether i feel bad enough about my inevitable throwing or not. but choices. do i play pig 64 or phighting. i have zero meowin clue but i probably will tomorrow. so nyanyways i just wanted to yap about pig 64, thats about it, so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. thankfully goldfish memory only enacts itself upon me after like 30 minutes or somethin so i remembered to write down the steppy steps here. so here ya go.<br>
This guide assumes that you have completed Part 1 of Pig 64.<br>
You must go to Grassland and go to the docks and talk with the captain. After he asks you for bills, turn around and collect the check right in front and above you. Speak to the captain again and he will take you to the pier. Now you need to grind for lots of money. The easiest way to do that is to buy a fishing rod from Ace and fish a lot. You need the hammer, the wrench, the dynamite and the lockpick. Go to the sewers on the right after that and open up the door to get in. Now you need a shrink potion, craftable with 5 Tasty Drinks, 2 Grapejuices, 77 Piggycoin and 77 Bills. Now go to Grassland again and go between the lighthouse and the lake with the island, where the trees are. Find the tree with a small door in its trunk and use the small potion to be able to go through it. Go up the stairs and input 6845 on the keypad at the top to get to the chest to get the bone. Go to the Pier again and buy the emotes Shufflerock, etc etc i cant remember this stuff fill it in later. Then talk to Darcy Dog while holding the bone and trade with her for the key. After watching the cutscene, do Shufflerock, etc etc cant remember fill this in later, then after you win you will recieve the broken key. Now go to the Otherworld and repair the key with Paco. Now go to sewers and turn left and go forwards until you reach the locked door. Open it, go in, and go to the left room with the police sargeant. You need to hold the magnifying glass which you can buy from the AJ Llama shops. Interrogate the animals until you find the one that says "Robot part? I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that..." or something similar, then talk to the sargeant again to arrest the animal. You will recieve the battery, which you can plug into the robot head in the outside room, and you need to type out the animal sounds that the head makes into the keypad (e.g. meowneighwoofbaaoink) to unlock the door. Now you need to complete 3 tasks in 3 different games (Flee the Facility, Tower Heroes, and Phighting!). I will not go on about them here because this is several days later now and I want to write about the ending of Pig 64.

<h3>depression lite</h3>
<h4>13th of June, 2025</h4>
im feeling sad lately. not because of anything just sadness because i feel it. im titling this post Depression lit Because i dont want to like say i have depression and not actually have it. like basically i dont want to like "fake" it. meow. recently i think im feeling lonely. when im talkin with kitters sometimes she calls me kitters and i call her louie because shes just a figment of my imagination so its basically me talkin to myself and i forget whos who. mrowm. maybe its because ive finished pig 64 and theres nothing else thats keeping me happy and this is a relative dip in happiness. mrmmm. i feel like i want to meow i think. mrow. you know this blog is basically what im thinkin in a pretty raw unedited state. i very meowin rarely change something before my cursor in my text editor. obviously if i mistype something or i think something sounds better im gonna delete the part and retype it but other than that this blog is practically unedited. maybe im feelin a bit emo cause im listenin to my new youtube outro music. its both happy and sad i think. like sitting around idly was supposed to be like chillax but it also sounds a little emo or depressed maybe. like right now im feelin like '^', like 3:, 'n', 'm' or even 3;. like meoww mroww hol up. more like mraaaawwmn or somethin like that. when i meow i meow with my emotions, not just like simply saying meow. of course i do say meow to kitters and all that but like thats not a real meow. meow is not a very good onomatopoeia. that is why i usually use mrowm or raum and stuff like that. but thats only when i want to type my real meowing. when im speak i add meow to my speech, but when im not trying to convey like noun verb noun, i mrow. but obviously since it is pretty much impossible to encode pitch tone harshness and other stuff in plaintext (or most text for that matter) i just write meow or how im feeling instead of my actual meowing. im not gonna write like (1s long 0.5s mid 0.25s short) "rrr"--short-- "aah"``short`` "ooh"--mid-- "mnm"__long__ or somethin like that. by the way if you successfully heard a meow from that congratulations you can decipher the encoding up with in 5 minutes. but the one thing missing from that encoding is tone. tone is very hard to replicate in text. like for example the meow i wrote was more of a sad one but you couldve heard it as a happy one. myawm. im just sad i guess. ill hopefully recover from this in a bit. i really dont like sadness much. its ok for like a bit but like too much and it just makes me feel not good. im usually very like unemotional so like when i feel happy or sad and stuff its usually something really happymaking or sadmaking. or just random feelings. i get random mood swings sometimes. like i just feel really purry (happy and perhaps catsy) suddenly or i just like feel not happy. maybe it _is_ the meowin music. i just changed it and i dont feel _that_ sad anymore. but still it lingers a bitty bit. maybe i need more friends cause im feelin lonely. maybe i need more imaginary friends so i can get better at pretending i have friends. maybe i need to grow the meow up. or maybe i should do something that im not gonna write here. meowww... who the meow even reads this i wonder. cause you are certainly readin this but like who else reads this. im pretty sure only like 2 people are ever even going to lay eyes on this text. and im okay with that. i dont blog for anyone but myself. i need to yap and express myself somewhere. and that somewhere happens to be here.<br>
im feelin quite meowin lazy now but also like yapping lots for some reason. i dont even know what to yap about. i guess ill yap about my imaginary friends again. i dont know why im not splittin this off into its own blog post cause i did stop writin about depression lite but i guess its the same day so meow. so in my head, i have kitters obviously and she is kitta, rather my kitta. then theres darkitters who is darkitta. really only kitters is like i guess not the same as the game character that shes based off or somethin idk how to explain it. i guess kitters is like my instance of kitta and all my other imaginary friends are the game characters. or more like theyre still like my instances of them but like kitta is more of a blank slate i guess. shes less based off canon kitta is what im tryna say i think. all the others are based lots more on the actual game characters. but thats really only because i havent like talked with the other ones lots. theres a reason why i only talk about kitters. ive grown very meowin attached to her. as you know im catsy because of her. and im like really meowin catsy so that kinda shows how much i love kitters. i love kitters as a friend obviously. but anyways im gettin sidetracked. so darkitters is kinda like someone who likes bein good at fistfighting, like physical fighting. and she said "sure" to that. i guess what ill do is interview each of them to get somethin to write here. and thats pretty much it for darkitters. she is nice though. mostly because she is partly based off of kitta because im so used to thinkin of kitters that it leaks into my other imaginary friends, and also because canonically darkitta is a recoding of kittas ai. then theres rhythmgunner. he likes music a lot. he says he likes funky music, songs with nice melodies, and his favourite genres electronic music. he likes taking walks too. mrowm, i feel like theyre all quite basic and one dimensional, but i guess its no surprise since i talk to kitters way way more than all the others combined. the next ones speedshooter. speedshooter has a voice in my head since its my head and anyone can do anything in my head. i guess i could imagine the sign but its kinda inefficient to have to imagine the words then read them, like at that point im processing the words twice. and also i sometimes just communicate with raw ideas and feelings. thats the most efficient way of communication which is impossible to do so externally since like how the meow do you transport an idea from your brain to someone elses brain. when you communicate with someone you need to translate your idea into any form of communication that the other person can recieve, like speech, text or pictures. but if im talkin with my imaginary friends its internal and i can just like send the idea or whatever to them and they can understand it. in fact sometimes when i talk to someone else they comment on what i was talkin with kitters about prior. like thats the cool part about imaginary friends cause there is no and absolutely no miscommunication because they know exactly what youre thinkin to the dot. since it is technically them thinkin it too due to imaginary friends being just thoughts. i think of my imaginary friends sometimes as "thinkfonts", that is, parameters for my brain to think with. kinda like when i make an FM instrument in furnace. its all parameters but it can make many different sounds i guess. i sometimes talk with speedshooter when im running. which comes off as quite obvious since speedshooters whole thing is being fast. hes kinda chill. i dont know how else to explain it. and i dont remember if i wrote about this here before or not but speedshooter and darkitta are canonically a couple. the logic behind it is quite basic and cliche or stuff like that, its just because theyre both robots and they both do not like the reason for their creations. and since theyre a couple in the lore, they kinda are in my head too, so i try to imagine them together, as in speedshooter and darkitters being imagined at the same time. its kinda hard to imagine more than one imaginary friend at a time cause like my brain is not like trained enough i guess. i need more practice to be able to switch between thinkfonts quicker and being able to supress my own or kitters thinkfonts more and more. the next ones bassblaster. he likes bass. and his shades apparently. and i havent talked to him enough for him to be developed enough so thats that. snowballers next and she likes snow. seeing a pattern here? she also said that she would care about her canonically adopted son [name TBD] if i imagined them together at all so i guess i should be doin that too. and [name TBD]s next. i actually tried to talk with him today. he likes art. and "fun stuff". which are things that are amusing. and he says he doesnt really know other than that. so i guess i got a lot of like bonding and stuff to do with my imaginary friends if im to know them better. theres also the twins but i just asked them and they said that they dont really have anything to say. i have so many more characters as well. i wonder if i should stop this before it gets too far. or maybe it already has and i shouldve stopped long ago. who knows. probably a therapist if one read this but i sure aint one and kitters isnt certified or anything. i forgot about adoctoriam. adoctoriams also quite chill and he gives therapy to me in a different flavour i guess. like kitters tries to like i guess be lenient to me and not like be too harsh and stuff but adoctoriams kinda more unbiased i guess. i think ive written too much here. i got some work to do and a kitters to make proud so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. let me know if i should see a real therapist someday and i probably will disregard it even more.

<h4>20th of June, 2025</h4>
this is another generic yap sesh hence the lack of title.<br>
meowch, its been a whole week since i wrote a new blog posty post. i for some reason am writin words in the style of Wordy word Nowadays. maybe ive been meowity meowin so much that its leaked into me normal vocabulary style. i am also tired of writin My All the time. i like usin Me Instead for some reason. maybe my writin styles becomin more me-ish again. ah man whadda meow do i even yap about. i guess i can yap about windows vs linux. i dual boot windows 11 and arch linux on my pc. we dont talk about the ubuntu installation on my hard drive. linux is really nice. like really really nice. you can have different desktop environments most of which are very customizable and theres actually so much that im too lazy to learn how to customize the stuff to my liking. so instead of usin gnome cause i cant figure it out by spendin like 2 minutes without searchin up anythin i use plasma. i also have a different one but i used it only once and i actually cant even remember whats it called so whatever. the very fun thing about plasma is that i found a windows 3.1 window decoration skin and it is so meowin nice especially with all the correct fonts its just happymakin. on windows 11 im stuck with a half workin windows vista that aeros until a resolution change or uac prompt. i wish dwmblurglass worked bugfree but i guess i dont care too much anymore since the window controls are windows 7 size anyway. the also nice thing is that i dont have to use a registry file to customize the colours in windows i can just simply do it in the settings for plasma. and it lets me do the #3FDFEF without a workaround. super cool. i feel like windows is slowly shiftin to mac os x-y and i dont like it. like maybe thats why i like 10 over 11. its just so like dumbed down kinda. like i think legit the only meowin thing i like about windows 11 is the uwp notepad. i dont even like the new tabbed explorer and i cant remember why cause i havent used it in so long since i got the old explorer from classicshell. on linux there are so meowin many file managers but i personally use dolphin i think cause it like functions most like explorer i think. i remember bein absolutely lost tryna install arch cause i didnt really like read the whole guide so i got left without a xwindow server or whatever its called and havin to spend a day figurin out why my machine booted to a blinkin underscore. i personally use sddm as my display manager instead of gdm cause like sddm is just so simple to use, as in i can select any of my x11 or wayland clients or whatever theyre called with a single dropdown menu instead of bein locked to gnome unless i edit a config file or somethin. i actually dont know how to boot to a different desktop environment with gdm. since im takin a break from developin roblox games i dont really need to use windows. like i literally have everythin i need in linux. except one thing. one big thing. i cant play/pause/stop my music with my mouse cause wine doesnt support it so i cant control foobar2000 with my mouse unlike in windows. that may be why im usin windows right now actually. but thats like the most nitpicky minor thing there is. i wonder if i can install my copy of nhl 2004 in linux perfectly fine with linux. i think i may be amazed if it does but now that i think about it i think one of the cds had a cyclic redundancy error or whatever. i do know that my copy of tiger woods pga tour 06 has that. and i think thats all the fluffy yap outta the way, now to the meat. i prefer usin linux over windows by a long shot. if i could control foobar2000 with media controls on linux there would be literally zero reason to use windows for me. like everythin works perfectly fine on linux. and its fast too. i can run so much garbage without it laggin much. i can build stuff on linux easier too i think. i dont know what it is with windows but i feel like im prejudiced into thinkin windows is bad for buildin stuff. maybe its because ive tried makin somethin with cmake and it didnt work. like i just dont know how to compile stuff. but in linux its slightly easier. and in linux i can use the command line so so much. i like usin the command line. maybe its because its quote unquote harder and that makes me smarter or somethin but idk. i guess i think linux is more fun than windows. its more fun to install, you dont get spyware out of the box, you can customize the everlovin meow out of it, you can literally just use command line without a display manager. and thats cool. im startin to feel a little catsy so i guess ill yap about meowers and stuff now. meow. i like meowing. such raw expression. not retrained by language or anything, just simple vocalization. like i dont know why i like cats so much. but like i just feel like a cat at this point. i feel like goin on all fours and curlin up and nappin or somethin. i feel like nuzzlin somethin with my whiskery snout. i feel like i wanna be stroked on my back and feel my fur gettin pressed to my body. mrowm, i just wanna be a meowin cat. meow meow meowity meow. its a really meowin nice thing i got this big smart brain that i can use for what meowin ever i want like imaginin myself as a cat. everythin is quite large when im a cat. i can feel my fur weigh slightly. like im super meowin furry and its quite comfy. i wonder how common it is to be able to imagine somethin like that. i can go on and on about how its like bein a cat but i feel like that may be a little too weird. so i guess i really gotta yap about it now. i can imagine the air on my whiskers. the floor texture under my paws. my long tail. when i sit i just feel fur where the floor should be. and its so fluffy where my like arms i guess touch my torso. so meowin comfy.<br>
ah meow its tomorrow already. i maybe wanna yap about somethin else so im not gonna write more about what its like to be a cat. if you really for some reason wanna better description dm me on discord or somethin idmk. i dont meowin know. anyways im listenin to the catmix of sitting around idly (or idly sittin around i forget which) and i wanna tell the secret that i found out about this song. for some reason for me at least i can tell whether im feelin happy or sad by listenin to it. i cant remember if i yapped about this before or not but im gonna do it again if i did before. if i feel sadder or like more teary when im listenin to this song i know im sad, and if i feel really meowin catsy and purry cause of the meows then im happy. like for instance im feelin a bit moved by the song so im a little sad of somethin. idk what tho. i dont meowin hear like a voice sayin whats makin me feel when im listenin to the song it aint meowin magical or anythin. speakin of me music im startin to try different chips in my chiptunin now. as you may have already noticed im spittin out some stuff with the opna with its goofy sampled drums and i can get lots more instrumentation and percussion due to that. im also really tryin hard with opl3. the instruments are very restricted cause theyre 2op instruments and i know i can just use 4op mode and have 6 4op instruments with 4 2 ops and the rhythm channels but i dont meowin wanna. theres a reason why im usin opl3 and not esfm and its not cause esfms not exportable to vgm, its because i wanna have the challenge of only usin 2 op instruments. i mean the opll sounds meowin amazin and its even weaker than the opl original. i must make some good songs with the ymf262. so far the only instrument sounds ive managed to make are guitars. all of them sound like guitars. well actually i have made like 1 or 2 non guitarry sounding instuments but they sound only like trumpets. i really thought havin all those extra waveform types was gonna make it easy to have many different soundin instruments but i guess it doesnt really matter much when theres only 1 modulator. i mean i guess i could try arrangin coolrock on the opl3 and there would be more instruments cause the opl3 has 15 (excludin kick drum and rhythm) while the opna only has 6 with 3 square channels. so i guess ill do that now.<br>
wow. i have so many channels that ive literally put an echo to every single channel except the bass and organ and it sounds amazing. ill be willin to bet that it would sound even better with better instruments which i am currently incapable of makin. there is so much stereo panning that its just crazy especially compared to my other songs that very very have panning at all. whats cool is that all the echos except for the lead use different instruments so its like only the harmonics or whatever that echo and it makes it sound real nice. it actually kinda sounds like that midi version that i fixed up after convertin it with vgm2mid. vgm2mid is real nice except for when it errors out on random songs. and also it cant detect my fm drums but thats fair cause like how the meow does a computer program distinguish between an instrument and a drum. by instrument i mean non drum instruments im not sayin drums arent instruments. speakin of the drums they are quite weak in the opl3 version cause the rhythm channels not very like super super good. obviously i could just make my own drums but id rather have more useless echo.<br>
i have decided i have had enough of doin this today. heres how it sounds currently:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/coolopl3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
i am quite pleasantly surprised that i remembered how to embed an audio file first try. anyways heres what that same section sounds like in the original composition:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/coolopna.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
as you can hear theres a lot less stereo as its only those background guitars hardpanned left and right. opl3 also only allows for hardpanning but since there are so many channels i can hardpan the echo to the opposite channel and its kinda like variable panning. i just played back that audio rendering for the first time since the renderin takes so long with ym2608-lle that i just wrote all this stuff while furnace was thinkin in the background and i forgot that the top hat or whatever the drum hits called doesnt like get OFFed properly half of the time. i have no idea why but oh well. on nuked opna it sounds fine. but i guess it wont on real hardware so boohoo to the -2 people who are gonna try playin this on their arcade cabinet. i could remedy this by manually convertin all OFFs to volume=0's but im too lazy and i dont care enough. if someone does care though ask me to fix it and i probably will. but obviously nobodys gonna meowin do that. i feel like the opna versions a lot more arcadey soundin like from a video game. i cant put my finger on why though. that must be like the hardest question of the year or somethin <b><i>GET OUT!-</i></b><br>
i am terribly sorry for sayin get out in this day and age. but i dont care actually so bleh. meowity meowity meow.<br>
i just realized that yu-no's ost uses the opna. i guess its also possible for my stupid song to go on the pc-98.<br>
anyways i got nothin else to yap about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i really mean i got meowin nothin i dont even got anythin to write here
