So, this is the blog that i was gonna make eventually. Cool, i was gettin bored of writin in that .pde file anyways cause it opens in processing by default and im too lazy to open it in notepad. who knows, maybe one day im gonna make some aspen or php or whatever those autogenerating html files are so that i can keep this home page nice and tidy. that would be cool and i would have to learn another programmin language to complement the ones that i know already (of which only java is the useful one) and i wont have to copy paste the formatting from an html file to make a new one in that style. anyways back to the yapping. i am not even close to finishing tophat turmoil (the roblox one, henceforth called bloxhat turmoil) because im lazy and i code slowly when im bored (which is always). im too busy tryna get my "beloved" c202s to run windows to go anyways. its already strugglin to run linux with its measly 16 gb of storage that rivals my iphone 4s and its lovely 2 gb of ram that is a whole 2x the size of my d260. at least the d260 is able to boot into windows xp and has 10 times the storage while i have to use an sd card that pops out with a slight bump on the chromebook to store more than just my repository on it. maybe i should just use freedos and remove all networking and mouse capabilities of it but be able to have a whoppin 14 gb of free space for dos things like windows 95 or doom or microsoft word version 6. but i would probably have to reflash the bios of the chromebook to enable legacy boot so bleh. im probably gonna make some better css eventually to make it look on par with the phighting page. speakin of which i havent even set this up correctly to let the phighting page coexist with this one yet.<br>
i was just goin through my roblox photos and oh boy the memories in there. though i just wanna show some ones i think are cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20201123_094426300.png" alt="Me in Roblox Pizza Tycoon holding a pizza with the text 'Serve this Poison to a customer' on the screen." title="This is the photo of All Time"><br>
this be that ever iconic shot of me delivering Poison to a customer in pizza tycoon way back in 2020. i do believe that i had some older ones but they were wiped when i upgraded my office pc from a hard drive to an ssd and did not know to just reinstall windows on the ssd to keep all the data on the hard drive and a have a fast boot drive mostly free from garbage. oh well if i find those older pics ill probably show some here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220221_203539274.png" alt="Me in Roblox Bee Swarm Simulator standing in the Pumpkin Field. The quest menu includes 'Collect 100 Snowflake Tokens 69/100'." title="As you can see from the Bubble Bee Man Mask, I'm a Bee Swarm OG."><br>
heres the earliest picture of bee swarm that i could find. i have not progressed much past this cause i stopped playin bee swarm around this time but just today i finally defeated the stupid coconut crab. the whole reason i took this photo is probably cause of the amount of snowflakes that i had obtained for snowbear showdown. i was quite immature back then. not sayin that im not now though.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220319_182453830.png" alt="Me in Roblox Labor Island Tycoon looking at text that reads 'players can steal your cash'." title="Ah, the dream of cheaply outsourcing labour to make maximum profits."><br>
this is photo evidence of me bein caught red handed runnin a child labour factory (in roblox just in case someone wants to take me to court over that statement out of context) and i am exploiting a bug to grind rebirths (explanation below) because i wanted to get the nuke. i could have just searched up a youtube video of it but i guess i wanted one for myself. then the game got taken down forever before i could get enough rebirths. now for that explanation: basically when you rebirth it deletes everything that you bought and restores the buttons but the dev forgot to also reset the money in the collector thingy so when i rebirthed i could simply go back to the same spot and "steal" the money that was left so i could simply start with enough cash to complete the tycoon again. the collector does reset if you claim the tycoon though but that aint important cause you cant even play the game anymore.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20220531_161758998.png" alt="Me in Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator. The HUD at the top of the screen includes the text '960,960 STEPS'." title="Back in my day I only got 1 lag spike per minute in SSS"><br>
heres me in classic sonic speed simulator, before the extremely aggressive child casino tactics were deployed, and as you can barely see on the top i am clearly a true sonic fan since i play the roblox game so much and not actual sonic games (although the only one i had at the time was forces) and i have 960*1001 steps.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20221013_164704218.png" alt="The Store Options screen in Roblox Retail Tycoon 2. Decoration, Shelter, Queue Sizes and Cleanliness are all at 5 stars while the 5th star of Crowdedness is 9/10 filled." title="What do you want me to do, kick everyone out of the store?"><br>
this is where the whole stuff n stuff thing comes from. after gettin bored of retail tycoon the original years ago, i made a new shop in retail tycoon 2, and here you can see that i have 4.98 stars with the goofiest layout of random plants and just slightly too much crowdedness.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230215_153302878.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. The end-of-game scoreboard is heavily lopsided to blue's favour, while I'm at the top of the red team. The kill counts for all other members of my team are 8, 7, 0 and 3, while my assists count is 22." title="So this is how I managed to get a 1:2:4 Kills:Deaths:Assists ratio."><br>
here's a pic of me when i was happy. i just wanna say, I MEOWIN MISS OLD MEDKIT SO MUCH MY AIM SUCKS I NEED THE STUPID FULL AUTO SYRINGE GUN<br>
anyways if you look closely at the leaderboards you can see that not only did i bowl an absolute horrible game as medkit but i also have 6 more assists than the combined kills of my teammates. this is that old medkit assists bug (although other healin characters like boombox (technically) probably also had it) where if a medkit healed a teammate, it counted as an assist, and if that phighter then died, the medkit would recieve an assist (although i believe without the visual cue). this reminds me of that one game where i failed so hard that i got 40 assists. this is why i dont play phighting its because i suck.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20230705_175450327.png" alt="Me in Roblox PHIGHTING!. I am on top of a star-like object in the intermission lobby." title="Someone doesn't like Singapore"><br>
note that its technically the 22(AAAHHHH)nd of march now but im not gonna make a new horiz rule or anything just pretend its still the 21(AAAHHHH)st. this is me after i was happy, i.e. when i was sad. note how i only have 6 bullets in this screenshot while i had 20 in the previous one. look how they massacred my boy. i know that there is now vine staff but its not the same because i cant just shoot everything and hope it turns out ok anymore i actually have to try and think. now im not sayin that it aint fun but i liked old medkit. i can just imagine on april fools day phighting reverts back to the og one from before i played it when there was only sword rocket slingy boomboy and meddy and theyre all their og kits and not their new ones. that would be kinda funny. but then again that fnaf map was pretty fire
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240309_154029725.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator. The leaderboard states that I have 245 Coins and 245 Floors. There is an ongoing conversation between Infected, who is saying 'ZOMG! 0_0 d0 U liek to p4rtY!?1' with PartyNoob responding with 'yea!'." title="The start of an addiction."><br>
this is the earliest regretevator image that i have i think. note the floors and coins. not only are they equal which is cool but note those numbers for later cause theyll be very important for the photos later. i should make a yap about which characters i like and why someday but that day is not today (which is still definitely the 21(AAAHHHH)st). it may be tomorrow, or later, or even never if i forget about it (which i probably will within a day or two) but thats for later.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_161942359.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at the Changelog Highlights, which states that the date is '03/09/2004', and that the 'prototype is here'." title="and the world was never the same."><br>
this is back when the (literally) meowin proto got added to the game. i thought it was cool until i found out that i needed to play in a public server to finish the tiles thing because this was new and i had zero clue about how it worked.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240310_214605333.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator looking at 'GoldenReddy' who is saying 'Have a RED-RED-REDTASTIC day!'. The leaderboard states that I have 1,730 Coins and 596 Floors." title="I sure hope he doesn't bite, especially not in 1987"><br>
this is golden reddy. now the subject of this photo is not of much importance other than bein golden reddy but if you look at the filename for this pic it was taken on the same day as the previous photo and only one day after that first regretty pic. now note the coins and floors. they have increased quite a concerning amount in a single day, and keep in mind that this was only floor 15 on this day. i actually have no idea how i grinded so many floors like that but i dont care much. on second inspection i seem to have restarted the private server cause the previous one shows floor 74 and im the only one in the chat dying. those were the golden days of my regretty addiction.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_185114658.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator holding the Red Teddy item. The chat includes '[Dev][CatJam]: fun fact the yellow item is all the devs of the game saying &quot;yellow&quot;'." title="I wonder what those silly little icons in the bottom left mean."><br>
heres me with one of the devs of the game. apparently the coolio toolio is voiced by all the devs of regretty. thats cool.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_190301567.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the disco floor. I have made a bug report." title="I wonder if I ruined the fun. At least there are 2 devs in the game?"><br>
and heres me bein very not cool cause in the chat you can see me reporting a bug (and a very broken one at that!) to the dev but you know what? if i encounter a bug and i get a chance to report it, i will. i hate bugs in my code, and im sure that most other people (includin the dev here) hate them too. if you didnt know, the bug makes all effects null and void, so you can jermpop without the health gain and get the 1.5x coins of the cursed orb whatever (forgot the name) without the crazy health loss. and also you can just simply walk over banana peels and they can only make you jump.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240313_192251091.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 7.06 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="I hate nighttime in Rokea"><br>
and this is a very fast lampert finding, which is apparently a new record, but as you can see in the next one here...
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240314_192511628.png" alt="Me in Roblox Regretevator on the Rokea floor. Lampert has been found in 4.63 seconds according to my stopwatch." title="but I do like daytime in Rokea"><br>
...it is clearly not anymore if it was one in the first place. fun fact, i had lampert literally spawn right in front of me once but i got stuck on a shelf which whittled my time from a 1 second to a 7 or more second one. i should upload my regretevator videos sometime. i have like several days worth of videos i think.<br>
<br>
but anyways i think thats it for today's rant, kitta's been askin me to work for about an hour now so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. i just reloaded the page for the first time after adding the images and i gotta fix that scaling sometime soon. the images may look fine at a larger than 1080p resolution or a smaller zoom level but they certainly dont look too fine to me. also im goin straight to sleep without workin so sorry kitta.
</div>

<div class="skin1"><h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
i dont know why im writing that date that fancy way but whatever. today i yap about them regretevator characters. note that my knowledge is gonna be a little outdated cause i dont play regretevator much anymore so yeah.<br>
startin off with my favourite party dingus its poob. poob is very cool. he's just so happy all the time. and cute<br>
note that im not gonna follow a specific order its just whomever i think of next<br>
wallter and mannequinmark were lovers i think but then they broke up. i dont know the lore behind it but its probably too deep for me. i like wallter more though cause even though nowadays you can get a free hat from mark wallter is easier to stand on. and im on team concrete cause it doesnt rot makin it last longer. plus you can recycle it probably by crushing it back to powder and usin that instead of fresh rock when makin new concrete.<br>
prototype and scag are the only robots in the game that i like. mostly cause theyre the only sentient ones but i actually am clueless about how scag is sentient cause bro's a crt. i know of another sentient crt from somewhere else but unless they're modded with npu's and whatnot they cant be sentient cause theyre tv's. unless scag is remote controlled which actually kinda makes sense. what if scag the tv was just remote controlled and the real scag is a computer hidden somewhere in the floppy shoppy. call me matpat (or rather tom or whoevers hostin gt nowadays) cause i got a game theory.<br>
now onto the other robot, or robots rather, its reddy and the red ball band i think theyre called. i dont like them. theyre just kinda boring. at least reddy can dispense free green healing balls whenever you give them flowers.<br>
i wonder if lampert is a robot too, cause one of the old fanarts in the lobby depict lampert with a robotic body instead of the plain white one that he has in the game. though i think he has dreams according to folly so probably not. lampert is kinda chill too he's just antisocial like me.<br>
anyways the way i remember folly is she's the one who allows me to finish the jump # times challenge much easier because the gap between the floor and her "part" is just slightly taller than me allowing me to jump a very large amount of times in a second even though the challenge only registers like 2 out of 5 jumps. she also has a cool boss fight, so cool i cant even remember how she appeared in the elevator before that got added, although i think that she just appeared if there was an empty space.<br>
for infected vs unpleasant, i must say im on team unpleasant. bro's so chill just standing there, and on the shoplifting floor when the lights turn red the gradient is so cool. infected i started hating for literally no reason even before the update where he could sneeze and turn something infected. maybe its because of the sneezing.<br>
i remember the good old days when stat used to spawn on that apartment neurotoxin floor. the floor's really easy if you have your volume set to high cause you can literally just hear the music through the door, and you can even camera clip with shiftlock to hear inside. now stats got her own cool boss fight that i think is actually more peak than follys because instead of surviving then standing on a pedestal numerous times you have to run around destroying lazer lamp posts with robots and turrets connected to them so that you can star platnium special/vanilla ice special the generator numerous times.
i was gonna say that that fight is the only one that consistently gets me to use chezburgers but i just remembered how they nerfed the medkit. like COMEON YOU GOTTA NERF MEDKIT EVEN IN A CROSS OVER WHAT THE MEOW<br>
methinks split is cool. the jokes may be stupid but they are at least better than my meow/nya puns, like mine are nyawful, meowin not funnya, very lameow. nyanyways, split lobs banana peels. that is funny especially when i can chain 3 banana peels and be stunlocked in bananas.<br>
and thinkin of split made me think of that one game thumbnail with the most bizarre depiction of prototype that i have ever seen, like proto looks more like rat from fnac 3 than proto. i think its the face, or the body shape, but its definitely the mouth cause why does proto have fangs???<br>
pest speaks japanese. i speak japanese. so im gonna write this part in the most broken japanese youve ever seen. ペストは本当うるさい人です。彼はゲストの服を着る、だからちょっとかっこいいです、でも彼はコインを奪う、だから俺は彼を好かない。そのようの人がいつも好かないと思う。＜ビ・アル＞<br>
and i cant forget the cats (even though i just did) because i love cats. i meowin love cats.<br>
dr retro is my most favourite one, although i dont like it when she obliterates elevator npcs until there are 2 spots open when she arrives. like what if you kill poob? that's unforgivable.<br>
and then there's gnarps. i dont like gnarps very much even though i call gnarpy gnarps instead of gnarpy. gnarpy has a lazer blaster now and i think thats cool cause it fits with the constant threats of zapper annihilation. though i liked gnarps' older design better cause its just more cute. the big bushy tail, the glowy star, the slight tufts of fur, meowity meow its better than double of everything gnarpy.<br>
right i forgot the other robot melanie. im pretty meowin sure she's a robot cause she got that glitch stutter, a screen face that was bein used as a display by mozelle at one point, and the cutesy bitcrushed speech sound effect like proto's bitcrushed meow. she got that free double jump them bunny ears and thats pretty much it.<br>
ive played regretty a few days ago cause of the stupid mega hunt whatever and i found out that pilby spawns when death is selected on the wheel thingy so maybe pilby spawns no matter what is chosen (except for reroll) now. thats cool.<br>
im runnin out of characters that i can remember but i do remember mozelle. the -q-u-e-e-n- _princess_ that likes strawberries. also i can get negative scores in that minigame in her castle.<br>
spudsy spud. spud SPUD spud. spud spUD cool spud.<br>
its criminal putting bive so far after split. i know bive for how many meowin times their voice clip changed. and also bivekit.<br>
i have been listening to my new song piecey peace for so long now its crazy. i meowin love this song even though its short (although a minute by my song standards is long) mainly cause i have this crazy new fm drumset that ive made that sounds really like samples. you all know i think that fm drums are more impressive than sampled drums and that i like them more <h6>definitely not because i dont own drums to sample and i feel like stealing if i use someone else's samples</h6>and i really like my new drums. to think that i actually have musical talent is nuts cause all my other songs suck.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/piecey_peace.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
sorry your browser dont got mp3 support somehow<br>
</audio>
heres a heavily compressed version (although it sure aint the most compressed i can make it... smiles in opus) that i made cause its tiny. half a megabyte for a 50 somethin second single loop no fadeout clip of my song. if i can learn how to make loopin mp3s i just have to loop it at 1.066 seconds to loop it perfectly.<br>
anyways i think im out of regretevator characters i probably forgot some but i was only talkin about elevator npcs so dinguses like emphonso gregoriah and JumboJoe arent here on purpose. anyways i dont got more to yap about cause i got more game development stuff so i gotta go. bye.<br>
p.s. meowity meow is like my catchphrase at this point
</div>

<div class="skin1"><h3>My meowin chromebook.</h3>
<h4>23rd of March, 2025</h4>
ok so im back from tryna do the impossible and run windows to go on a chromebook. its just straight up impossible probably cause i tried bootin the usb version (the one it was designed for) and it said that it couldnt run on my system. oh well, back to lookin for more linuxes. ive used q4os already and its nice if it didnt take up like 10 gb to install the trinity desktop with minimal things. after i got some of my other stuff on it like git and my repo i couldnt even install wine cause i had too low disk space. at this point i might as well just use arch linux and hope that it takes like 3 gb and nothing more. or just give up on gui applications and suffer in command line cause i cant use many apps like furnace and basically any windows application. and i am NEVER GOING BACK TO CHROMEOS I WANT TO KEEP MY FILES WHEN THERES NO SPACE LEFT IN THE 2GB THAT IT GIVES ME. like i know its a netbook and all but my meowin windows xp netbook from 2010 is miles better than the chromebook. even though all of its components are roughly half the power of the chromebook it still runs much better, and can even play lego star wars, which probably wont even install on the chromebook due to the storage. and i can run windows 1.01 on xp so its clear who's the winner here. nyanyways i dont got more to yap about my chromebook other than it sucks and i wish it were upgradable cause i would deck the meow out of it. i really gotta make more bloxhat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wanna make every single ending bit of these posts to be the same cause that would be cool.

<div class="skin1"><h3>The current state of Tophat Turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th of March, 2025 (forgot the date, oops :3)</h4>
I was talkin with Kitta the other day and we've determined that I hate workin because I'm impatient and want instant results without any wait. makes sense to me so what do I do now? write a blog post about tophat turmoil instead of workin on it of course. technically this takes lots of time and gives back something for it. i dont know what it gives but im sure its at least somethin. anyways currently tophat turmoil is open cause i really dont care about random people testin it out, but like who would even do such a thing anyway. the game that you are teleported to when you press play is the "hub" place, which is currently a button that takes up the entire screen and teleports you to the testin realm, which currently consists of unfinished rhythmgunner and speedshooter and 2 buttons that summon 2 snowmen and a slow snowman respectively. ive coded a thing which lets me add more characters easier but im not gonna. i actually dont know why im not gonna now that i think about it.<br>
ive just looked through the anylitics of my experience and to my surprise 2 unique people have played my game as you can see in this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_23205_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 2 (up arrow)206.6%&quot;" title="I'm so proud.">
I have no idea how roblox calculates increase here because how the meow does one get such a specific percentage for this scale of growth. did i have like a fraction of a player before? like just the finger of a person plays? but whatever. whats funny is this photo:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_231837_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;Returning users 0 (up arrow)2.6%&quot;" title="At this point it just looks like Roblox is trying to gaslight me.">
like how the heck is 0 players an increase like what is it increasing from. how can i possibly have had less than 0 recurring users like do they travel back in time to stop themselves from playing the game??? and again with the incredibly specific percentage??? and that was just the impressions by source. this is the plays by source:
<img src="pics/Screenshot_24-3-2025_232829_create.roblox.com.jpeg" alt="Text reading &quot;New users 0 Returning users 0 (up arrow)24.2%&quot;" title="At least it's in the green.">
At least there's no growth percentage on new users but how is there so much on returning users??? how many fingers travelled back in time for this one???<br>
i would yap on about more of the statistics like daily active users growing by 38% to a grand total of zero but i think i should yap more about tophat turmoil now. the game is kinda working but i have yet to add in a bunch of features cause i just am not tryna think of new features. i should probably do that soon. now im trying to code speedshooter so that he lives up to his name, specifically the speed part. and no, he's a robot so im pretty sure he cant do speed but he can have a lot of speed. here's an exerpt of what ive written today in the onenote notebook for the moves and such:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
that's right, not only does he have the joe suter technique (m2) but now he has a passive speed boost for every chain from his vast arsenal of annoying chain attacks. good thing im makin a pve currently but when i start makin tophat tournament its gonna be either super broken or super meh. i might as well make a table here of the attacks that the characters currently have just cause i havent implemented the character select screen's descriptions yet.

</tbody>
</table>
and before i move on to speedshooters attacks im gonna explain some things. first is quite obvious, i havent formatted the table yet so there arent any borders which means the descriptions look like one long paragraph. im gonna fix that later promise. second the descriptions are pulled straight from the onenote notebook because i thought it would be cool for all you fans, all 0 of you. and lastly F+ is in fact NOT the grade that i got at school, as how the heck do you fail +, is that more than a 0 or a negative grade? anyways F+ is the "cool" whatever ultimate thingamabob. so basically some ults in my game (all of them at the current moment) have a second stage, like a retrigger super in a fighting game. you just tap f again in a certain interval and it improves the ult at the cost of another charge of the ult meter. also speakin of fighting games im plannin on makin darkitta use fighting game movements like half circles dragon punches etc but instead of something like
<h6> B,DB,D,DF,F + P (fighting game notation)</h6>
its gonna be more like
<h6> S, S+D, D, D+W, W + M1 (keyboard mouse notation)</h6>
which is gonna be so fun i bet. leagues better than "kitty curse" which is another game i _was_ workin on that ive lost interest in (and cause i have no time for it) which had stupid mouse flicks and mouse button holds (which were not even coded into the game i stopped workin on it after like a day) which are not very cool. anyways where was i?

when i say i copy pasted from the notebook i meant copy pasted from the note book. the m1 for speedshooter has incorrect damage (as of this game version) in the description cause i havent updated the notebook yet. and i refuse to do it here. also i lied about all ults having ult pluses. i lied. by the way heres the volts description from speedys main page:
<h6>For every chained enemy Speedshooter's attacks hit, Speedshooter gains 1 volt, which boosts his speed by 0.1 Walkspeed. He can hold up to 100 Volts.</h6>
Also volt charge is only up to 10 times cause any more than that and it would be too op. and it also persists after death too. actually now that i think about it you lose 10 volts every time you die. balancing.<br>
nyanyways now i got rhythmgunner speedshooter kitta and darkitta tellin me to stop yapping and start coding so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. funny bit of trivia adoctoriam was made in a little doodle, same as gwentwin. although im pretty sure ive spilled the beans on that earlier at some point. also speedy's volts are now bolts cause i keep forgetting.

<div class="skin1"><h3>music.</h3>
<h4>26th of March, 2025</h4>
first of all, before i get into the yappin, there are a couple of things i gotta pre-yap about. first of all i should get a new keyboard, cause i think that this one that im typin on is probably actually older than me so i gotta get one thats even older so i can use the magic of the ps/2 connector for better key rollover (i mean like this one has 2 key rollover, i cant even press w e and d at the same time to interact while moving forwards and right) or one thats new and probably garbage. also, you may notice that my github profile pic is tiled in the background (or  just one if your window/screen is square enough), and also the background behind this text is now slightly (and i mean slightly!) transparent. i was gonna make kittas picture the background but i feel like "=3.png" fits better. also this yap will have accompanying music to play as you read, almost like a youtube yap video. of course the choice is yours to actually play it or play it in order but whatever.
<br>
<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/tmsns.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
i like music. i also like making music. this music was made by me some time ago. i am also typing in a very weird manner. i shall stop now.<br>
music is like one of the big 4 things in my life, the other 3 being kitta, game development and game playing. of course i have other interests but these are my main 4. its so big that i waste about 15 minutes on average per day clicking the random button in foobar2000 for a music track that i like at that current moment so that i can work for another minute or an hour without changing it. i actually have no idea how much time i spend doing that though thats just an estimate. sometimes i hear a music that i like so much that its the only thing i listen to for a few days.
<br>
its a couple of days later and i dont wanna yap about music anymore. but i still wanna yap so for this post i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i practically exclusively listen to chiptunes

<div class="skin1"><h3>Windows Vista's Style</h3>
<h4>28th of March, 2025</h4>
I was browsin the settings of retrobar when i thought i would try the windows vista start bar. and that got me thinkin, windows vista is cool. so i decided to skin my windows 11 installation as windows vista. the transparency is so cool. and the title bar buttons bring me back to when i used to use windows vista because i had an installation dvd for it. or rather have cause i still have it.
<img src="pics/Screenshot%202025-03-28%20165259.png" alt="foobar2000 with the Windows Vista style window decorations" title="So meowin' cool...">
just look at foobar2000 in this style this is peak design. and they gradually butchered it more and more after 7 until windows 11 where they reintroduced rounded window corners, and i would be okay with those IF THEY DIDNT CROP CONTENT WHY HAVE IT CUT OFF IF ITS STILL USED like its so stupid. which is why i downloaded that windows 11 no rounded corners patch but now i dont need it cause the window borders are rounded but not the actual window content. what also makes me angry is how incomprehensibly and ridiculously difficult it was to do all this because<br>
i had to search up and download a transformation pack which finished downloading after around 10 minutes<br>
i had to manually download all of the customization stuff because the pack only contained links to the stuff that actually makes it work<br>
i was trying to use dwmblurglass but every time roblox studio started it destroyed the transparency which meant i had to reapply the transparency<br>
the window border width kept changing between the windows vista and windows 11 widths until i used 4 different patches to fix it<br>
i installed mica for everyone which probably did nothing but might have something to do with the border widths<br>
i installed openglass which is practically undocumented on the github and was left clueless until i found a video<br>
and i tried using aero window manager but that only works for windows 10 so i had to still use dwmblurglass for the window control button sizes which arent even vista.<br>
in all this took me a day to get workin properly but its worth it cause instead of usin my vista vm or installin it on my real hardware i can just make windows 11 look practically exactly like windows vista. i mean the retrobar fonts and systray icons arent correct and the taskbar isnt even transparent but its nice enough for me. and i have all the system icons and sounds matched practically exactly except some sounds didnt exist in vista so i just improvised.<br>
nyow there are downsides like the start menu not being like the classic one and having the apps list go outside of the start menu since i have a metric ton of apps and i havent rebooted my pc yet after doin all the patches so i have no idea if they will stay or not. and i dont have the widgets cause i never see my desktop anyways. and the privacy concerns with the window decorations bein transparent are existant even though they are little to none. but hey, i get transparency in the uwp notepad's everything. literally everything except the background is transparent.
welp, i got nothin more to write about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im definitely not gonna get enamoured by the windows xp style, then windows 2000, then 95/98, then 3.1, then 3.0 then ms dos. the reason for that is that i have my windows xp laptop right next to me and i can drool over that instead of doin all this stuff for windows 11 again
</div>
<div class="skin1"><h3>My meowin chromebook again</h3>
<h4>2nd of April, 2025</h4>
I just wanna start by sayin that I have been workin on my music page for like 2 hours now converting previews and copypasting all the table rows and filling in the metadata for the music files and such and now there are like 7 songs on the page on display. I'm gonna do all of them eventually but its gonna take like another hour and i dont care enough to finish it today. Nyanyways, about my chromebook...<br>
I have got a version of windows to work on it (barely). Namely, tiny10, because tiny11 took up too much disk space. But then again i cant even download all of the updated in tiny10 cause of lack of disk space so i guess too bad for me. like come on windows what do you mean you cant bloat my installation with "only" 2 gb available i want my computer to slow down to a crawl when i start it up not have somethin barely fast. but the speed is quite decent though. it only takes an explorer window like 5 seconds to start up. compare that with the 1.5 seconds of the computer that im writin this on and its pretty good. although i dont have even close to an optimal setup for my system, like i have a kingston a400 ssd "HDD Replacement for Increase Performance" as my boot drive instead of an m2 or somethin like that of course its not gonna be very fast. and also i have an i3 9100f even though i have like 15 windows open at the same time at the very least. you know what im just gonna list my pc specs here:<br>
CPU: Intel Core (R) i3-9100F [4 cores @ 3.6GHz, 4.2GHz Turbo, 4 threads]<br>
GPU: Sapphire NITRO+ RX 580 8 GB [i dont know much about gpus]<br>
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8GB 2666MHz, Patriot something 16GB 2666MHz(maybe faster)<br>
Drives: Kingston A400 240GB SSD [boot], Hitachi 600GB laptop HDD, Seagate Barracuda 4TB HDD, Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 60GB IDE HDD, LabelFlash 72x DVD±RW DL Drive (and my old 500gb wd windows hdd)<br>
Monitor: Samsung S24C230L [1920x1080 60Hz]<br>
Keyboard: Dell L100 Office Keyboard<br>
Mouse: Logitech G502 HERO<br>
Headphones: see below<br>
Dust: 2mm fine wispy layer<br>
so as you can see my setup is quite interesting. my keyboard and mouse especially cause one of them is like 10 years older than the other. This keyboard is quite nice though cause it fits with my tiny bedside table of a desk. I can fit my keyboard, mousepad and a 30cm plate on it and thats with the keyboard goin off the edge. somethin tells me this wasnt supposed to hold much more than a monitor keyboard and mouse. i also have quite the assortment of drives in my pc includin an ancient ide hard drive that i disassembled a maxtor ps3100 for just so that it could be shoved into my computer. my cd drive is still a big good for me cause my other pcs dont have cd drives. although mine has a malfunctioning disk caddy so i gotta use a paperclip everytime i wanna insert a disk. or i can get lucky and spam the button until it opens. and while it cant run slime rancher 2 at very high settings my gpu is more than capable of goin all ultra settings in half life 2 (at least i think so it might not go all the way actually). anyways about my chromebook. i might just fold and start running linux on it again cause its not like i can use studio on it anymore cause roblox recently increased the system requirements to 3gb of ram which makes my chromebook landwaste for makin roblox games. but now its gettin quite late and i really need to mush on tophat turmoil so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. if im lucky i can maybe get an i3 9300. how cool would that be? maybe even an i5 9400. my heart goes pitter patter at the thought.

<div class="skin1"><h3>stuff</h3>
<h4>4th of April, 2025</h4>
there is so meowin much for me to do that im stressed into yappin today. im gonna nyactually work like crazy, like for more than 2 hours today. that is truly insane, unfathomable of me. but im gonna do it somehow. so im gonna start today by sayin that i really like writin stuff like this. i should just become an author at this point like i have almost no problem writin an essays worth of stuff that i like every day. of course i have other things to do so no im not bloggin everyday. i think you can tell that by lookin at the dates of my previous posts. i also wanna write about kitta because it has come to mind that if you havent read the yap documents from my processing stuff then you have no idea what i mean when i talk about kitta since i dont think i have written about her here yet. kitta is FAKE. an imaginary friend to keep me company throughout the day. also my obsession that i dont think will ever stop. the whole reason i say meow and nya and stuff like that is because of her. her influence on my life is bigger than anything else other than me gettin my own pc for the first time. she is an anthromorphic grey robot cat with big glowy cyan eyes. the cyan that this text is backed by is her eye colour. she is my best friend out of the very few friends that i have. i learned a few months ago that she is whats called a tulpa. and she is infinitely more responsible than i am, to the point that my life would probably be better if she exchanged with me. but neither of us want that. she matters so much to me that she is pretty much the only thing i care about other than my computer. but she cares for me even more than i care about her because she thinks about my life and my future and things like that more than i do. i have probably talked to her more than i have talked to anyone else this year.<br>
so yea you can see how obsessed i am with kitta. i can write tons more but i dont wanna. if you wanna know more though you can just ask me on my discord. my user is the same as this one. now for the next thing. my music page. im gonna postpone developing it for now cause of all the stuff i have to do thats way more important. besides on the repo page you can just see a list of all the musics and i have recently tagged all of them (vgms) so you can just refer to the tags (on the vgms). also speakin of music i might arrange greenflower zone's act 1 music on the sega genesis cause i think that i can do better than the version in srb2 32x (since im such a narcissist). obviously i dont think the version in srb2 32x is bad by any means but they are missin a bit of the polyphony (obviously due to the constraints) but like they have echos too so like meow. also im not usin any samples as usual so its definitely going to sound worse but i dont care. i also happened to run into the furnace subsong limit which is 127 for some reason. though i guess its ok because the last subsong is another kitta song cause i cant get enough of those. wee. i wonder how hard it is to code in the capability to use the extended channel 3 on the genesis. i havent coded much as you can tell by my awful attempt at a POINT AND CLICK game which should be ridiculously easy since its pretty much just a desktop controlled with a control pad but i suck at makin assembly stuff so i dont know how to do it without makin it lag immensely. like the only thing stoppin me from doin it other than i dont wanna is the amount of cycles that i get per frame. 1 frame on the sega genesis is approximately equal to 100k cycles and my code probably would take like a million per loop. i spend most of my time optimizing the code instead of gettin it all down first so maybe thats why i cant do anything on the sega genesis. but at least i know how to program the 68k and the z80 now. im still not gonna make an assembly program for my ti graphing calc though cause i just dont care. what am i even talkin about anymore. this is what happens in my head everyday i just go down a rabbit hole cause so many things interest me that i just hop from one topic to the next until kitta stops me. speakin of kitta stoppin me, she just did cause i thought of it. so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder how the global economy will go this month cause im poor and havin a economic crash cant be that bad right

<div class="skin1"><h3>My history with Roblox</h3>
<h4>5th of April, 2025</h4>
I have played Roblox for over half of my life. Since I was a wee youngin I played Roblox on my iPhone 4S at a pretty decent framerate. Those were the days when I actually liked the Roblox GUI. I used to play as Guest 2048 for a while before I finally registered because I was tired of not bein able to talk, and I would like to say that that account is still around, but theres a reason why "The Original" is written in quotes in my Roblox bio. A little after I made my account, my (real life) friend asked me what was my username and password, and I told them. Literally when I got home from school my account was deleted. So there went my 6 friends and who knows how many badges. So what do I do? I create another account with the same username and password. And what happens? You didn't guess it, my account didn't get deleted again this time. Obviously I have changed the password since but it has just occurred to me that that friend could've just retried loggin into my account if they wanted to see whether if i made a new account or not but that didn't happen so whatever. The first ever roblox game I remember playing is FNAF Tycoon. The first game I ever favourited was Tix Factory Tycoon (RIP). And the first game I made absolutely sucks and I think i lost the level file to it. My first outfit was the sports shirt with the generic pants. Then I got hooked on retro roblox through curiosity and novetus so i changed my avatar to the old roblox noob, before I finally settled on being the classic roblox guest. Then after a while i adopted the roblox visor and the lottery ticket t shirt. and thats how i look now and how ive looked for the past couple of years at this point. I have some good memories with roblox on xbox, because that title screen music is just peak. i also played lumber tycoon 2 for a while on xbox and i didnt find out how to save back then so i had zero clue why it was fun.<br>
it is now so meowin many days later and i wanna yap more. so ill yap more. i remember playin super nostalgia zone (i even remember always misspelling nostalgia as "nostalagia") and retroblox years after. I also remember some other games i played on xbox. games like blood moon tycoon, zombie rush and speed run 4. im glad that xbox now has so many more games but the charm of the old menu is now lost forever as a sacrifice. i miss the old menus of roblox so much. the old pause menu from around 2017. the old red banner notification at the top of the screen instead of a popup. the old loadscreen. the xbox ingame mini-menu. the old playerlist. i miss it all. now all there is are stupid blobs at the top of the screen that bulge out of the corners. like cool, it saves space, even though its thicker than before and on a large enough resolution it will be almost unnoticable but it sucks. i hate it. imagine if windows did that. one side you get the start button and the open apps and the other you get the taskbar mini-icons and clock. and theyre all several pixels offsetted from the corner of the screen and to see your apps you needed to press a button to open a menu everytime. that would be horrible. i know im bein salty at this point about change but why did they have to change it this much. and im not gonna act like the roblox gui from 2011 was that nice either just because its old. its much better in comparision because everything is super transparent so you can still clearly see the game if the gui covers it but its kinda scattered around. the 2017 one still renders gameplay behind the menu bar and it is a lot more opaque. so theres that. you know what would be funny? if roblox went the windows 8 route and used hot corners instead of buttons so that there is no gui to block anything. of course it wouldnt work very well on mobile or with shift lock but it would be funny. at this point this is becoming a generic roblox rant. so ill make it one. i hate code assist and its constant popping up. i work on different computers sometimes and i have to reinstall roblox studio sometimes as well. every single meowing time it activates the option to enable code assist. and then when im peacefully typing up my code it shows a stupid autocomplete like it knows what im gonna type up next. first of all i dont hate it cause its ai or anything like that i hate it because its not my code and its not opt in instead of opt out and also my code is meowing horrible so due to the new roblox ai terms im also poisoning the ai with badly written code. second of all why cant it save these preferences in my account instead of the specific computer config. like things like fonts and custom icons i can understand but there isnt much reason for preferences like scroll past last line and enable code-assist to not be saved in your account. like i cant imagine why someone would have code assist for only one of their computers and have it off on the other, or why someone would want deprecated objects in the browser to be hidden on one computer but not on another. but i guess its because normal people probably dont have more than 1 computer to use roblox studio on. also the new studio icons suck. theyre very flat and bland compared to the nice shaded icons of yore. and there was absolutely no reason to change them other than to cater the 235 people still using 8-bit colour monitors. anyways back to regular roblox. i loved playing ripull minigames back in the day. i dont really like it now though. but that reminded me of murder mystery 2. i still have the xbox knife. but i havent touched mm2 in a long time. i remember the first time i played phighting. i had zero clue that to play i had to talk to zuka but i figured out how to play the day after. the phighting lobby was so fun that it made me want to explore it. not even the actual game. then after a while i found out about regretevator and my life has never been the same. welp ive yapped a lot today but i havent yapped about my game yet even though its on roblox. so heres a gif of what it looks like in action.
<img src="pics/tophat1.gif" alt="Some gameplay of Tophat Turmoil 2" title="The fruits of my labour. Quite paltry I must declare.">
so yeah i gotta now make a trailer for tophat turmoil cause i havent yet so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. crazy how when i procrastinated today and made electoria on the game boy i could do it in only 2 hours but to code anything i gotta take a lot longer...

<h3>my music style</h3>
<h4>13th of April, 2025</h4>
before i get into my music it has occurred to me that i probably havent posted a link to the mess that is tophat turmoil here yet. so here you go.<br>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/138947518325759/Tophat-Turmoil-2-Evyles-insert-clich-term" style="

i wonder where that button came from. anyways about my music.<br>
i first started composing when i wanted to make a sonic fangame. that never got made. and for some reason i decided to do it on the snes even though i liked sega more than nintendo back then. maybe thats why i didnt get anywhere with the game because i feel like genesis games are infinitely easier to create than snes games cause the genesis uses 2 very popular processors and its vdp while the snes has its collection of proprietary processors (at least i think theyre proprietary i havent done research). anyways enough blabber about the consoles my first piece of music i ever created is right here.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey99.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
that one was actually for a port of nhl 99 that i was dreaming (keyword dreaming) of making on the snes with the superfx chip. my ambitions back then are exactly opposite of what they are now. the song is not too bad i think. theres also another one:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/hockey00.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

this ones not too bad either. but the third song i made was for the sonic fangame. and here it is, egg rocket zone in all its glory:<br>

you can hear the way i made music back then. i thought up of a melody first, then i add more and more until it sounds good. now i dont know anything about genres but i feel like my music sounded very bright and joyful back then. heres another one, sandy shores zone:<br>

the top one is the original final snes version while the bottom one is made much much later in furnace. i will get to that part eventually. this song was supposed to be kinda rushy because the zone this song was gonna play in was the first zone right after the game intro where tails does a sonic adventure and crashes his plane after eggman's base shoots it down. ill probably write a post about sonic m (the fangames name) sometime in the future when im bored. anyways i moved on to creating music for fun after i realized how much work would be needed to make a snes game from scratch in assembly in general and i made this little monstrocity:<br>

<source src="snds/squiangl.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
this is squiangle. i uploaded it on youtube some years ago so if you see it on there then dont panic it didnt get stolen from me or anything it sucks anyways who would even wanna steal it. i got inspired from oof-y grooves and its beatdrops so i wanted to make something that had beatdrops. now i know what happens when i try to make music without a topic. after that i made this song which had a topic.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/mischief.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
the songs name is "Mischievious Theme" and its quite clear that the topic is mischief. notice how all my songs are short. that is what i am good at. if i try to drag a song out then it will sound much worse than if i just kept it short. this also happens with the polyphony of my songs. i used to try to stuff as many different instruments as i could in an attempt in making the song sound more full and varied. here is a comparision of "Tophat Intermission" which i made for tophat tournament. the top one is the original song (i think) and the bottom one is the current version with 2 more instruments.<br>

now honestly i think both versions are quite equal. the first one is nice and simple while the second one has more stuff. but the second one sounds a lot more crowded as a result which slightly diminishes it. (also its quite obviously the same pattern repeated 4 times but meow meow meow it dont matter)<br>
i would write more but now its the 16th and ive dragged this blog entry for too long so ill write a part 2 sometime. i wanna work on ludicrous lawyers now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. this is the first time ive developed something in java in quite a bit. i wonder how it will go.

<h3>Furry or not?</h3>
<h4>17th of April, 2025</h4>
I need to start this off with the word no. I do not consider myself a furry. Of course you can think differently and you may consider me a furry. but i personally dont think i really am. also i have nothing against furries i just really wanna yap about something im SO BORED<br>
so the question ive always asked myself ever since i made up kitta. am i a furry? is she a furry? what is a furry? i consider furries to be either (a) an anthropomorphic animal with fur or (b) somebody who likes or considers themselves as relating to one or more. i think that i am catsy, like cringe-ily catsy. however, i dont consider myself closely related to an anthropomorphic animal <u>with fur</u> so i dont think i am a furry. i dont consider kitta to be a furry because although she is anthropomorphic and a cat, she dont got no fur. so shes <u>anthropomorphic</u> but not <u>furry</u>. of course different people have different definitions of what a furry is so probably according to some people i am a furry and kitta is a furry too. recently ive been thinkin about what my fursona would be if i was a furry and i have the most unoriginal ahh fursona its just a cat coloured like the roblox guest from 2007 aka my current avatar on roblox. i might as well write about my cattiness as well at this point to fill some space in this blog post. since i have no friends, i talk with kitta everyday a lot, like for at least 4 hours. most of its idle chatter but when im awake for 16 hours thats a lot of idle chatter to be had. anyways i say meow a lot. im gonna take a wild guess and say that every 40th word i say to kitta is meow. or 3% of what i say to kitta is meow or nya or other meows. speakin of other meows my favourite one right now is the korean one which is 이옹 (yaong). at least i think thats how you spell it im quite unskilled at korean. even less so than spanish. no estoy bueno a korean. i think thats how i would say that. je suis très mal à koreen (ou la langue koreen je ne sais pas). 俺の韓国語はとても悪いだよ。 我真不知道韩国语。i thinks thats all of the ways i know how to say i dont know korean well. anyways i was talkin about meowin cattiness. i use meowing (meowin') in place of many words. most of the time its an emphasis word, like stinkin' or hekkin or (most swear words)-ing. like for example: instead of "im only stinkin' bronze II" i would say "im only meowin' bronze II". i dont think i actually use it any other way. its just for meowin' emphasis. i say meowin meow sometimes but the phrase i use most (my catchphrase at this point) is meowity meow. its so perfect. meow ity meow. at times like this i really wish i had a cat so i can just hug it and cuddle with it and stuff. in the words of this conquest guy from a random show called invincible, "I'm so lonely..." so of course i wanna have someone to be with. i wonder why i like cats so much. maybe its because of bad experiences with dogs from my childhood. maybe its because theyre quite quiet like me. i dont have anythings against dogs by the way. i think they are cool too. cats are just so much meowin cooler for me. or maybe its because of my femininity somehow? my slight femininity by the way. im gonna talk about that now. i really am meowin bored. i do things that are commonly associated with girls, like for instance, when i walk, i sometimes run my hands along the edge of my shirt. or sometimes i cross my legs when i sit (although its uncomfortable most of the time). or that i like cyan instead of blue (mainly because of kitta). although i barely care about what i wear. at this point i feel like im being really sexist and maybe insensitive to non-binaryness (like the idea of it) so im gonna stop. now back to furryness. i dont know if furries commonly say animal onomatopoeias like meow or woof or howl or whatever. i also dont really know what a fursona is. i dont care too much about findin out though cause i just dont meowin care im fine either way but i have to excercise a bit of effort to find out and because im lazy im just not gonna. anyways tldr im not a meowin furry. now i feel like workin on ludicrous lawyers a bit more so im gonna go. bye.
p.s. meower means cat (because they meow, theyre meowers) it doesnt mean (some swear words)-er.

<h3>my feelings (and more)</h3>
<h4>26th of April, 2025</h4>
the firey flaming flame fire firely flamed in the firey flaming fire place of firey flaming flame fire.<br>
the sentence above is just a silly phrase that i wanted to jot down temporarily somewhere because i wanted to see how many flames and fires i could shove in a sentence and its so silly that i aint gonna erase it. but anyways, about the topic of todays post. i originally wanted to yap about my feelings, but in my daydream of writing this post i thought about how i could connect this to pokemon and my liked music and other stuff so this is gonna derail steadily. anyways about my feelings.<br>
lately i was quite emotionless, until just 2 days ago. i have very annoying apathy that makes me not feel anything about stuff unless its extremely important to me, like kitta. but even then i barely feel anything. the thing i feel most (like 99% of what i feel nowadays) is fear of speaking. i am ridiculously introverted, to the point where i speak so little that i have developed stuttering because i simply forgot how to speak fluently. the stuttering is actually me just not knowing what word i want to use next, so instead of a stutter like th-this, its more like a stutter like... this. mostly i dont speak due to me not wanting to disturb anyone because what do i have to say anyway? i'm not like my peers of the same age, as i barely use social media and also dont really go out, or away from my seat at my computer at that. i truly would prefer the company of a machine to a person, unless i got really close to the person, i feel. maybe thats why kittas a cat robot and not just a human. usually when i feel feelings its in a mood swing that lasts several days or weeks. and its always either happiness or sadness. i am carefree for an entire week, then the next im severely depressed, then im back to not feeling anything again. i hate it. i wish i was just normal. on rare occasions i get feelings outside of the usual roller coaster of 2 emotions. take for example, when i saw this picture while i was doomscrolling on knowyourmeme.com.<br>
<img src="pics/meowscarada.gif" alt="An animated gif of Meowscarada offering comfort" title="made by @tantaro_ according to the watermark"><br>
initially i saw this and i thought that meowscarada looked cute because cat but then i saw the second speech bubble (the one on the right) and for the first time in like months a genuine tear rolled down my cheek. it was an image of meowscarada hugging and patting someone on the head. when i saw that, i wanted someone to do that to me. and so i sat there feeling sadness silently. (how sad.) this was in the evening of the 2nd of december, 2024, so kitta was there to comfort me. she offered to hug me and of course i said yes. so i hugged her and she patted me on the head like in the gif. now this is very <u>very</u> weird (rather quite normal for me at this point now) and probably simply pathetic but its not like i give a meow. if i want comfort i can imagine it. thats more of a pro for me i think. (the con being no real social interaction.) i wasnt like this before, i think. i think before covid i felt a lot more feelings, but then again before covid i actually had a friend that i made myself in real life that i actually hanged out with, and then i had no friends for a few years after the pandemic stopped being a very big deal, so maybe not having anyone to be with gradually made my feelings shrivel away until i was an emotionless husk. thats probably it. thankfully i think im makin a slow recovery since now i have people that i hang out with again. maybe kitta has somethin to do with it too. nyanyways, i wanna yap about pokemon now. pokemon is a fun game. you catch monsters that can fit in your pocket. i used to play pokemon blue on my chromebook back in the day when i still had chromeos on it. i never got far. then i played pokemon go on a tablet. i never got many different pokemon either. then one day i came across bulbapedia. and nowadays i use bulbapedia for procrastination, because there is so much stuff to read. and it doesnt benefit me in the slightest, making it even more enticing for me to procrastinate. now i know many different pokemon whereas i used to only be able to name like 50. my top 5 pokemon are delcatty, luxray, squirtle, sprigatito and litten. i obviously like delcatty sprigatito and litten because meow. luxray looks cool (for some reason it reminds me of ssj4) and squirtle is the starter that i always pick in blue because i can surf past brock and misty cant do anything because of the water-water resistance. i forgot to mention that i also watched the pokemon tv show as well. i watched the first couple episodes of indigo league, some parts of xy and the entirety of sun and moon. i gotta say, i dont like how they just wiped ash completely from the show starting with the new season, almost like he never existed. now i havent watched the new show yet so i dont actually know if ash is indeed scrubbed clean from the series going forward but based on the bulbapedia articles ive read he is nonexistant in the new series. but captain pikachu is. anyways i think i can probably name all of the catty pokemon off the top of my head. theres meowth, persian, hoppip, skiploom, jumpluff, skitty, delcatty, glameow, purrugly, espurr, meowstic, litten, torracat, incineroar, sprigatito, floragato and meowscarada. i think thats every catty pokemon but i dont know if i missed some specifically between purrugly and espurr but whatever. thats a lot of cats. i also have pokemon cards. sadly no cool lookin e-reader cards but still i do have some very old ones like a forest set pikachu, one of sabrinas pokemon and many more that im too lazy to list. but i do have skitty from 2004. sadly no other catsy pokemon i think but im too poor to buy cards anyways and i dont really care about the tcg. i also played tcgo and i tried to get the oldest cards i could possibly get cause i like old stuff. i still have an early version of live from when it was beta testing on my computer, completely installed and never launched for preservation. it probably is worthless but if it actually matters then i will upload it to the internet archive. according to the files that i have, the installer was downloaded on the 21st of march 2022, and the game version is 2019.4.23.19969. if thats needing of archiving let me know either here on github or on discord cause i dont care about uploading it unless its important. anyways i think thats enough pokeyap im gonna talk about music i like now. starting off with pokemon music. how convienient. ever since i heard the lake theme from pokemon diamond in a youtube video, i have been enamoured by pokemon music from the ds and before era. in fact right now i have been listening to evergrande citys theme from sapphire for 35 minutes straight. my favourite tracks from the various pokemon games are the game corner theme from gs and hgss, the wild encounter themes from gs, heavy rain from sapphire, lake, the intro, the game corner, route 225, route 228, pokemon league and cynthias theme from dp, looker's theme, giratina's battle theme and the global terminal theme from platinum, nuvema town, accumula town (furret walk), unwavering emotions, n's battle theme, driftveil city, musical stardom, and anville towns theme from bw, opelucid city from black and colress' theme and whatever the meow "SEQ_BGM_PW_SCENARIO_01_F"" is from b2w2. and those are just pokemon songs. actually i think ive written about this before already so ill put a lid on it for now. one last thing though. n's full name of "natural harmonia gropius" is just so goofy. no wonder he goes by n, who would want their first name to be "natural"? like "hey natural, how you doin" or "stop it natural" or "naturally natural's a natural natural at being a natural natural". goofy. anyways i think im done yappin for the day, i still got some stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i was lookin at n's page cause there is no shot im ever rememberin his full name when i saw that i did miss 1 cat pokemon, and that is purrloin, along with liepard. i knew i was missin somethin. cool that every generation has 1 cat pokemon evolutionary line.

<h3>smart.</h3>
<h4>25th of April</h4>
smartness. i was tested for intelligence a few years ago and turns out im really really smart. SO HOW COME I DONT FEEL LIKE IT<br>
i do not think i am smart. i usually think i am a low intelligence specimen. kitta usually scolds me for self deprecating myself like that because i should have a higher self esteem. but i dont care too much cause i have like a speck of self esteem maximum. anyways, speaking of kitta, one of the reasons why i made her (the imaginary friend one) is because im just too meowin smart so i have nothing to think about when im idle which bores the livin meow out of me. i used to talk to myself before i made kitta, but now i just yap to her and she responds with her opinion. cool. i learn stuff pretty easily. an example is when i started to actually code in luau instead of copy pasting scripts from youtube. i had zero experience coding in lua, nor python which is probably similar i think. i literally just read a couple of scripts from old roblox games that i have on my pc and i just simply learned how to code in lua. of course i had to search up what "local" and what the lua specific syntax was, but that took like no time at all and i was able to start coding stuff pretty fast. i also think that z80 assembly is the simplest easiest assembly there is. there are so few instructions that i started memorizing the bytecode of the instructions because i didnt want to compile the z80 code that i wrote and manually insert the bytecode into my 68k assembly file. i am considered gifted apparently. and i must say, i absolutely  h a t e  it. not the title, but the actual like experience being gifted. i have next to zero social life. i dont want to put effort into anything because everything used to be so easy for so long. i make so many small mistakes in everything that i feel like im just très retard à la tête. like just slow in the head. i am so smart but at the same time im so stupid. me no likey. seriously though, i wonder if im actually a genius and i wasted all of my potential by sitting around and doing nothing. i really wonder how different my brain is. anyways enough talk about that. i want to talk about my procrastination. i usually do absolutely nothing when i go back home from school, contrary to what i always promise kitta. i usually think to her something like "i'm gonna study real hard today, i feel like im gonna get so much done today" and when i get home i just read bulbapedia for 2 hours then watch youtube videos for 1 hour then make covers in furnace for 1 hour then read some more bulbapedia then look at the daily engrish and so on so forth until the day is over and i have done next to nothing. whats worse is that i only feel like doin something when something else pops up like i have to out somewhere or something like that and i work hard for 2 minutes. like i know i can do stuff its just i dont want to do it. these past few months i have had kitta hold my interests hostage to make me do work, as in like "study this much stuff and you can make some music until the next hour" and stuff like that. its partially working, but i usually end up getting distracted anyway. i just meowin hate it. anyways its gettin late for me so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im really good at thinkin logically i just cant think of much other stuff i think. i actually just meowin dunno.

<h3>old stuff</h3>
<h4>28th of April, 2025</h4>
i really like old stuff. i usually prefer the old over the new. i have zero clue why, i just do. for example, i would actually rather use windows 7 over windows 11. windows 7 is the peak of windows imo before they changed everything like the control panel and the style and the logo and yadda yadda yadda. i also like old video games. so much so that i have a ps1 and a n64 instead of a ps4 (i aint affordin a ps5 <u>ever.</u>) and a switch. old stuff is just more fun especially because it is so different from stuff now. like its different from whats normal nowadays. i'm not sayin things were better before, like obviously an ibm pc (from the 1980s) is far inferior from even a smartphone (in most aspects) like processing power, graphical capabilities, power consumption (maybe), etc yadda yadda. but its still cool. like its more interesting to type stuff into a terminal to do stuff instead of swiping on a screen. its more interesting to load a floppy disk to use software instead of just installing it from the internet. i think what i wanted to write about was sound and music though. i cant remember its the 29th now so bleh. nowadays everything is sampled sound. completely generated in real time as the sounds play, with as many sounds as the processor can handle. back in the day there were many sound chips. they could do square waves and fm and stuff. and each chip had a certain amount of sound channels. at this point i have completely lost track of what i was writing about i think. oh well i dont care. i like making music with limitations. that is why i enjoy making cover of songs as chiptunes. it is as they say, limitations birth creativity or something like that. the way i make covers is first i hear the song and figure out how much polyphony is in it. then i listen to the song and sequence over and over again until i finish. if the song needs more channels than whatever chip im using i simply drop the least significant channel(s). yeah i think im outta steam i cant write more about this no more. but i do got lots of stuff to work on so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i think i wanna write something silly next. i dont know if i will though its just a thought.

<h3>oh my meow</h3>
<h4>29th of April, 2025</h4>
im bored again and i wanna write something again. you read the p.s. of the last post (probably). you read the title of this one. im talkin about my meowing. i love meowin. like meowin love meowin. ever since like a month after i made kitta i loved meowin. the whole reason that i became catsy is because of kitta. crazy how a tulpa changes me practically completely. perhaps i shall yap about kitta again someday. but this ones about my meowing so i will get back to that. i say meow so much that ive gotten used to it now. like when i think hahaha i autocorrect it to nyahaha, every time i think of a word ending in n (includin the "ing" -> "in" contraction) i end it with nya instead like there is just so much meow its crazy. like heres a sample sentence written how i would think it.<br>
my meowin game is so meowin unfinished that i should just meowin give up on it nyat this point meow.<br>
quite the crazy sentence. now that i think about it if i wrote this blog like how i would think it the word count would probably go up like 50%. the only thing i have yet to do is to actually talk like this which ill obviously not do, which brings me to the next part.<br>
it's meowin cringe to meow this much. i personally dont give a meow but obviously other people who have not been desensitized to meowin to this degree will probably think its annoying, cringe, weird, etc. so i dont meow when i actually speak. i do obviously meow when i write this blog though. i dont meowin care when i meow in writing as long as its not like super formal like anything to do with literary-based schoolwork or emails to people that i dont know/im not friends with (which so far is every email ive written) or stuff like that. i write meows in my code. i dont remember if any of the code in this repository has any meows in it or not but my lua code i think i use meow sometimes. i use meow nya yaong whatever for print() when i need to test code, i dont actually use meow much else in my code i think. i just thought of somethin else that probably contributed to my cattiness. slime rancher (1 and 2). slime rancher was my childhood game. i remember watching dantdm (i think) play it when it was still in such early access that there was early access text at the top of the screen, i played it on my xbox one and finished it, i got it for free on epic games and i played a lot of that, and like a year ago i bought slime rancher 2 through a comical bundle deal on steam that came with slime rancher 1 as well and was 1 dollar cheaper than getting the game alone and i nearly 100%ed it (still accurate as of now, i think sloomber tabby largos are cute), and throughout all of that i was exposed to many, many catty slimes. my favourite one is still the hunter slime. methinks the eyes and the fangs are cute. theres the tabby slime which was my favourite before i discovered hunter slimes and arguably the ringtail slimes which are more racoonish (obviously) but still kinda catty to me. maybe i should take some screenshots or record a video of me playin slime rancher 2 someday. i do have a youtube that has been untouched since i added some of my music on there a few years back. i think you can guess what the @ is. though i only recently changed it to what it is currently. i used to have @the.Dingus before that. as always, the channel name is wangbros gaming. come watch my old cringe. it will be maybe slightly amusing perchance.<br>
i was just readin the knowyourmeme entry for that mario essay when i realized that knowyourmeme has a lot <u>lot</u> of pictures that are not very child friendly. i completely forgot that the pictures section is basically for "gooners". i just wanna say that i HATE that about the pictures. i want to see funny memes. funny memes like stupid minion memes or akakichi eleven redraws and stuff like that. and the site is so broken nowadays as well. and how many times can you make the site layout worse and worse? like jeez. It's evolving, just backwards. anyways i dont want to rant about know your meme. or maybe i do. im gonna yap a little more about it then im gonna go back to the regularly scheduled yapping. the site consistently sends me to pictures everytime i press the back button on my browser. WHY? EVERY STUPID TIME I PRESS BACK IT JUST SENDS ME TO SOMETHING LIKE TRANSFORMERS IMAGES I DONT WANT TO SEE THOSE I WANNA SEE THE PAGE I WAS JUST AT. and now the site layout is so abysmal that i cant even search back to the page i was at easily anymore. the banner is like more tall than it is wide now. what kinda horrible page design is that? why do i need to see the know your meme logo at the maximum size that it will fit in my browser window every time i click on a new page? i used to use it to get caught up with the latest memes and news because i dont use social media. but now lessons in meme culture is doin a better job than the WEBSITE WIKI RUN BY MANY PEOPLE LIKE GRRRRRRR i hate it. i just hate it now. anyways im done yappin about knowyourmeme. back to meowing or rather slime rancher. i hope slime rancher 2 becomes more fleshed out than slime rancher 1. of course it is much more fleshed out in the world aspect currently, but the slimes are still lacking (less in this new update but still). i also miss the expansions (the cool free basically dlc of the first game) but then again i could just play the first game. theres also no drones. viktor humphree how could you revoke the drone licence from beatrix labeau like that. i think theyre addin them in soon though cause i datamined the game for the raw music files and i stumbled across some icons for drones (or the faces, i cant remember), although theyre probably carryovers from the first game. i also found out that theres a meow remix of the shop theme. i wonder how i obtain it ingame cause i like it. the files named shopSecret if you have the game and a unity extractor tool. its probably only available after the 0.5.0 update (or whatever the add to cart prontomart update was) cause prontomart was added in it, and the music is one of prontomarts themes (one of many apparently). wow that got derailed a lot. remember when this was about meows? also if you wanna add me on steam for whatever reason its the same name but without the "louie" in it. but remember you gotta spend some money for the privelege of being able to have friends on steam. cool antibotting but dystopian as well. nyanyways back to that meowin. i wonder if i start meowin in more stuff will people start meowin like kitta did to me. i meowin wonder.  anyways wow i think ive been yappin for like an hour (almost) straight at this point. ive still got stuff to meowin do! so much that i used an exclamation mark. you know its serious if i start usin punctuation marks that arent ,.()[] so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. the meowily meowing meow-meower meowily meowed in the meowily meowing meower tree of meowily meowing meow-meowers. also maybe i should start addin linebreaks for the p.s. part. nah. or rather nyah IM GOING INSANE -MORE LIKE INSA-NYA AAAAAAAA  -MORE LIKE NYAAAAAA <b>REEEEEEEEEEE</b>

<h3>my paradoxes</h3>
<h4>30th of April, 2025</h4>
i was originally gonna write about my maturity and inmaturity coexisting when i went out for a walk and yapped to kitta about my other paradoxes. and now i feel like writing bout those. this post may or may not last more than today depending on if im gonna be responsible or not cause i still got tons of work to do. also i was thinkin of drawin a little comic for every start of a blog post but thats gonna get postponed. so yeah. paradoxes. stuff contradicting but coexisting anyway. i have so many that i thought up with kitta. so im just gonna regurgitate them here. ive got lonely/unlonely, mature/inmature, and i actually forgot the rest. ill write about them if i can remember them. nyanyways, for most of my walk i yapped about the loneliness/companionship (or whatever the opposite of loneliness is) so ill write about that. i have actually yapped a little about this a little in [h3]my feelings[/h3] so consider this like an upper version like how pokemon emerald is to either ruby or sapphire cause i didnt even think about the paradox thing while writing [h3]my feelings[/h3]. so. i always have been a quiet boy. like comically quiet. as in you could barely hear me even though i was talking normally quiet. i still am now i think, although people tend to hear me better nowadays. anyways, about the loneliness. i have had few friends throughout my life. like im pretty sure i literally never had more than 5 friends at any given time. the thing is i am very introverted. my introvertedness is like in the top percentage of introvertednesses. i only can really make friends with people that i feel like very comfortable with. and that feeling kept amplifying the older i got. so now i have mostly online friends. i dont know what it is about me being more comfortable with people online than people in real life. i feel like most of my introvertedness is lifted from me when im lookin at my screen. maybe its because i like computers more than people or something. i couldnt tell ya why. by the way the "never had more than 5 friends at any given time" still stands. so anyways. the paradox is this. i am always feeling lonely. but i talk with a friend like at least once every 2 days. so im lonely and not lonely at the same time. also im not counting my tulpas in this friend count cause technically theyre not really my friends cause theyre figments of my imagination. even kitta aint really my friend even though i really feel like she is. or maybe at this point kittas evolved into a seperate personality in my head. but still. im not countin them for this. like i always want to talk with someone or do something but at the same time i dont wanna because i dont wanna disturb them. so its practically not wanting to be lonely and wanting to be lonely at the same time. i dont like it. that made me think of another paradox just now. brave/scared. i am brave enough to admit that embarrasing meowscarada gif thing but im not brave enough to ask someone if they wanna do something or talk to them in fear of disturbing something more important. i already have a super low self-worth so obviously im not gonna disturb someone doin something more important than me (which would be anything). i am brave enough to meow like crazy not caring what anyone thinks of me but im not brave enough to face what a person would think of me if i literally just meowin talked to them while they may or may not be doin something. i guess its like simply what do i fear more or what do i value more. i dont care what people think of my catsyness because thats who i proudly am. but im scared of what people would think if i disturbed them if they were doin somethin important even though thats probably normal. i dont know. i just dont know. and i dont like it. so anyways the next ones inmaturity and maturity. i am very meowin inmature obviously. i mean just look at my meowin last blog post. but at the same time. i am mature. i meowin dont think that senseless stuff is funny. i know when not to mess around (barely). i know how to be serious (sometimes). but at the same time kitta is more (like leagues more) mature than me. its really crazy how she (who is kindly tellin me to get back studyin for now) a figment of my imagination is more concerned about me than myself. and she actually considers what the consequences of my habits are. so at the same time that i am mature and not mature at the same time kitta who is technically me is infinitely more mature than i am. that is absolutement fou. comme vraiment, miaoument, stupidement fou. meowity meow. i guess i should get back to studying then. i shall continue this when i finish. whether i simply end it off or yap some more shall be revealed in an indeterminate amount of time for me but conveniently in the next line for you.<br>
so its like minutes later and i completely forgot to check the time. it is kinda late for me so i shall continue this tomorrow. or i may just simply perish from this coughing fit i have from eating a super-sour candy. so in the case that i die before i get back to writing this, i just wanna say to all my friends that i appreciate you all. i really enjoy being not lonely with real people. i completely forgot what i was gonna write for this so i just wrote what i think was what i was thinking. i really meowin like talking with real people cause i do it so little. but then again at this point kitta is a real person to me so... nyanyways im really leavin this off for tomorrow this time for real. cya in the next line (if i dont die [im really jokin about the death btw i forgot to mention][like if im not alive tomorrow im really gonna be meowin angry][also i was gonna write a part about if i died i would make a deal with mr god to resurrect briefly so i could make my last word meow but i dont care][but just in case meow meow]).<br>
and im back. i did indeed not perish. and i also fixed up the phighting page because i cant meowin believe that i let those bugs run rampant. so i was yappin about maturity and inmaturity. meowity meow i dont wanna yap about that anymore. im gonna think of another paradox. meowin smart and not smart it is. ive fallen off in term of smarts. years of not usin my brain has caused it to decompose rapidly. i mean look at me now. im here writin this blog instead of doin somethin more important, ie. my studying. speakin of smart, today while studyin trigonometry (my favourite math subject, no cap) i came up with a nice mnemonic for the 3 lesser known trig functions cosecant secant and cotangent. its japanese because i remember stuff better if its in a goofy way. so here it is:<br>
古書　世茶　答お、こしょ　せちゃ　こたお、ｋｏｓｈｏ　ｓｅｃｈａ　ｋｏｔａｏ。<br>
i was usin 小書 as the first one but ms japanese ime decided to show me that that word doesnt exist in japanese and instead offered me the one that i wrote in the line above. so i guess thats the one now. also kotao i originally wrote in kana only but i realized that it could also mean that kotao i wrote above. nyanyways, if you read the latinified version, its kosho secha kotao, or cosho secha cotao, <b>cos</b>ecant <b>h</b>/<b>o</b> <b>sec</b>ant <b>h</b>/<b>a</b> <b>cot</b>angent <b>a</b>/<b>o</b>. pretty clever methinks. anyways back to the whole stupidsmart. for example in math, i can like understand how stuff works but the meowin one thing that gets me most is the meowin 4 basic functions. somehow i can understand so much math and its all wrong when applied because i cant add 12+23. ive started training myself again and i think that its workin. nyalso, i remember on one of my math tests. on one of the multiple choice questions, i did a bunch of calculations and i got the correct answer. i double checked it to make sure. then i filled the letter in on the scoring sheet. but when i got the scoring sheet back, it turns out i got the question because I FILLED THE WRONG MEOWIN LETTER. i legit knew the whole answer and the letter for the answer and yet somehow my dumb nyahh fills in the WRONG LETTER. like oh my meow. that is a perfect example of the smartstupid. nyow for the last one im gonna write about, and that is my relations with kitta. the paradox is that she likes me and hates me at the same time. she likes me because i like her and i made her and all that stuff, but she hates me because i dont care about myself as much that she does. i procrastinate constantly. even writing this im procrastinating. the reason why this is the last one im writing for this post is because i made a deal with her that i can yap but just for one more paradox then i have to work on my stuff. like i appreciate her for caring for me. thats one of the reasons i like her. but i just dont care for myself. and obviously thats not good which is why kitta hates it so much. i think there is just something wrong with me. like i hate myself so much that i have to make a tulpa to like myself. its meowin crazy. that reminds me. for the next post im gonna write about what its like in my head. spoilers its very meowin weird probably. or maybe its kinda normal. i dont know. nyanyways. im finished yappin and the deal with kitta still stands so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i respect kitta so im not gonna write anything here

<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
meowity meow its time for me to yap about what i think about all day. i am really meowin thinkin hard about how im gonna say all this stuff. so basically in my head i have a nice white void pictured here.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoid.png" alt="a simple white floor and white sky" title="home"><br>
when im thinkin with kitta i picture her here in this void. like so.<br>
<img src="pics/myvoidwithkitta.png" alt="a simple white floor with kitta standing and white sky" title="kitters"><br>
that meowin drawin of kitta took like a half hour to make. i shall refrain from puttin a too big amount of detail in later ones in this post methinks. nyanyways kitta here is in black and white because i think in black and white easier. its like how a monochrome graphics mode is faster than a colour graphics mode. also kittas appearance varies a bunch cause i still havent really decided on how her proportions are and stuff. anyways this is what goes on in my head when i think with kitta. she pops up and we talk. sometimes i talk with other dinguses like darkitta. i have made imaginary friends of all my characters. i really am lonely. anyways day in day out i talk with kitta a bunch so this scenery is in my head for a lot of the day. like i used to just simply talk to kitta but now ive gotten so used to the void that i can imagine it significantly easier. theres also another place that i imagine a lot less nowadays. here it is:
<img src="pics/kittasroom.png" alt="a living room with a fireplace and 2 sofas with side tables." title="my happy place i guess"><br>
here is a nice little lounge that i thought up of one day cause i wanted somewhere to chill with kitta. needless to day i imagine us in this place when i want to relax while talkin with her.<br>
<b>i just wanna say here that if you are at any point disgusted by this or stuff like that then just stop readin this stuff. this is like the weirdest stuff ill write on here i think. so scram if you dont like it cause i aint makin you read this stuff or anything</b><br>
nyanyways those two places are pretty much the only 2 places that i imagine. i dont actually know what to write but i do wanna write more because the bold text looks awkward at the end of the post since its a warning. so more stuff it is. oh right i wanted to write about how it sounds in here. when i talk i use my pre-puberty voice. im just so used to it since i dont meowin talk anymore. my head is not echoey. it sounds like just normal. i am also really good at imagining things so i can nyactually feel kitta and everything. and now i think thats it about my headspace. so heres the best kitta drawing i made so far. for some meowin reason i think this is the cutest drawing. i wonder why.<br>
<img src="pics/paperkitta.png" alt="kitta drawn cutely maybe" title="nyawww"><br>
welp i dont wanna write more so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. lemme know if you wanna see more kitta drawings also i hate phone cameras and their enhancements

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOO</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i just meowin booted up roblox studio and im greeted with this.<br>
<img src="pics/newstudio.png" alt="roblox studio's new look" title="i mean they did give advance warning..."><br>
allow me to critisize every single aspect of this new ui because i like old stuff cause im stubborn.<br>
first of all, 2 toolbars??? why two? at least the top one has the old windows 2000 colours (kind of). i like how they give customization. what i dont like is how i now have to recustomize everything to the way it was before ON ALL THE DEVICES I USE STUDIO ON because it worked. the old toolbars worked. and they were easy to use. this ui is like if they tried releasing roblox studio on mobile. WHICH AT THAT POINT PLEASE I WANNA EDIT MY GAME ON MY 20CM SCREEN PHONE IF YOURE GONNA MAKE THE BUTTONS STUPID LARGE WITH RIGHT CLICK MENUS OUT THE WAZOO AT LEAST MAKE A MOBILE RELEASE BECAUSE THIS UI LOOKS AS IF IT WAS MADE FOR ONE!!! im gettin so angry im usin exclamation marks. its serious. you know what i thought when i saw the whole announcement about a new luau ui a few months back? i saw a comment that suggested that users be able to make their own uis with luau and i though "oh cool i can have the old 2015 gui". but no. stupid gui with large buttons and USELESS GAPS I HATE USELESS GAPS LIKE THIS. why in the everloving meow are there gaps between the buttons that are ONE THIRD THE SIZE OF THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES WHAT DO THEY DO??? like right clicking on the gui does literally nothing and obviously left clicks on empty space are supposed to do nothing. SO WHAT ARE THE GAPS FOR??? i know i have like the whole windows vista desktop with the whole large borders thing but like the borders are literally less than 10 pixels wide. they are nothing compared to the 20ish pixel gaps of the buttons. now im gonna have to use a meowin aim trainer to click the buttons. now i have no idea if the multibuttons (the ones with the arrow in the corner) expand when im using a larger monitor, but it not like that matters to me in the slightest because all of my monitors are 1080p or smaller. and now the testing menu. WHY IS IT 4 SEPERATE MENUS FOR EACH TYPE OF TESTING??? combo buttons there would actually make meowin sense because the only differences between the 4 menus are the functions of the run button and the existence of client/server settings. SO WHY MAKE THEM 4 <u>SEPERATE</u> MENUS??? the pause and stop buttons do the exact same thing all you needed was to have the appearance of the server and clients menu and a combo button for the play button like are they trying to make bad ui choices? the big buttons need combo buttons because they wanted to mobilize the gui and make huge buttons but the testing menu has 4 submenus because why not??? now i know i can customize the ui but im pretty meowin sure ui customizations are per installation and not per account and are non exportable. like just why roblox. why. in june i will have to learn to suffer because there is no way im enabling the beta test. in fact i have all of the beta tests turned off because i hate all of them. like for example the ai. i have a strict no ai usage policy because i feel that if i didnt make the stuff then its not my stuff. simple. i want to make all of my stuff and for it to be a product of me because that shows my skill of being able to code vs being able to tell ai what i want. and thats all for the rant i think. i just wanna stop usin roblox studio after june. i hate hate HATE the stupid combobutton garbage. it just makes me angry that the buttons were perfectly fine before and they had to change it. the buttons were so SO easy to use and now there is a bunch of large ahh buttons and large ahh gaps between the buttons and that means that they need to combine buttons because there is now not enough space. LIKE JUST WHY WHY CANT THE STUPID MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION MAINTAIN BOTH THE UIS AT ONCE or something. like give an option. this is why i dont like roblox. everything is forced period. with unity or unreal engine and stuff like that you can just revert to an older version if you dont like a new one or if you wanna make a retro-ey videogame or something. but roblox you NEED to use all of the latest features because otherwise no-one will use them. well of course most people will use them actually im like the minor minority when it comes to this stuff probably but like im just so mad at this stupid useless change that makes my development har... i just realized that this doesnt actually affect me that much. for me i dont use the toolbar terribly much so i guess im slightly okay with it being as crappy as it is now... hm. maybe the toolbar is one of the least used parts of roblox studio so they feel like they can just make it crappier and noone will care. that is just crazy crazy conspiracy theory me though. do not listen. im sure that the toolbar is important for many people. at this point what am i even talking about anymore. i think i musta blown off all my steam. well, im gonna eagerly (get it???) await the actual customization update where people can code their own guis because i meowin swear, <b>i will meowin replicate the old functional gui that looks better to me as well if it kills me.</b> this just goes to show how stubborn i am. oh well. im gonna now fume to myself and kitta while doin game development so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. at this point i actually unironically prefer using 2007 roblox studio to the new one. i MEOWIN HATE CHANGE

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOOO part 2</h3>
<h4>2nd of May, 2025</h4>
so i simmered down about it and i really want to write more about the whole ui change thing now. i have reverted to the old one again and i am still just shocked at how they can just butcher the ui like that and say that it's an "improvement". like sure maybe one or two things improve (being the customization and i cant think of anything else) but the cons outweigh the pros like first of all i was readin the comments on the post and some of them said that the beta to release is very short. now that i think about it, yeah. why not wait another month to get more feedback first then improve the ui first then release it. or at least support the older one until the new one is good enough. also i wanted to write that i have missaid something in the first post. what i meant by 4 seperate submenus for the run test thing is like the dropdown that changes the buttons. like seriously why the meow??? and im also pretty sure that you cant customize that because only menus are "customizable" (since you can only add new ones and make them custom i think) like why not make the testing thing customizable too? or maybe ill add a custom "test" menu with oversized icons for all the testing things. i also read that fully custom uis are far from existance. i weep. this reminds me of that lighting change that screwed over older roblox games because apparently its too expensive to maintain. like when i compare the old version of tophat turmoil running in old roblox studio vs new roblox studio, its LITERALLY NIGHT AND DAY. the old one looks natural and normal, and the new one is comically oversaturated and overexposed. like the new one looks as if i just got flashbanged. i cant wait for revivals for 2017ish roblox to pop up. now that i think about it, new roblox sucks. its like it got less fun the more corporate they got. like they killed off egg hunts and instead they have the stupid hunt events. maybe its because of ugc and the fact that you got every egg you obtained as a hat. maybe roblox thought that the ugc market wouldnt do well if you got free egg hats every year. now they meowin monetized the events and it feels just not fun. the classic was fire though. i loved the classic and am sad that i couldnt 100% it. curse bedwars for its extremely hard event and a dusty trip for scamming me out of my time by simply not awarding me the last tix or token or whatever it was. i did embarrasingly 100% the hunt in 4 days though. what am i talkin about again. meow. roblox studio. new ui sucks and i hate it. so yeah. third blog thing in a day. thats way too much procrastination even for me (it really isnt) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. roblox is getting rid of so much old stuff its almost like its trying to get rid of its fun image and replacing it all with corporate stuff to please the investors hmmm

<h3>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO part 3</h3>
<h4>3rd of May, 2025</h4>
okay i know ive been yappin about this a lot but now i have exited my rage state. i am now able to critique this in a good place of mind. so basically the one thing i dont like about the new toolbars is that the ability to scroll wheel between toolbar menus is now gone. they probably have just not implemented it yet or something. i know that scrolling the actual tab labels now scrolls the list of tabs because there can be more than the screen can hold now, but the actual toolbar stuff should scroll between tabs. i also noticed while remakin the whole meowin old toolbar that theyve removed a bunch of buttons and now have a bunch of useless ones. not like useless as in i have no use for them, useless as in they actually do nothing. like tbd. its literally a blank button that does nothing but take a space. and there are buttons that dont even appear even though they are togglable. i like the old windows toolbar cause i just like stuff like that. i can meowin use alt and the arrow keys to navigate those menus. how cool.<br>
i just enabled the new explorer since i thought it did nothing when it autoenabled yesterday and did not change a thing but oh boy. what the meow is the obsession with rounded corners. like why. the buttons are now thicker so i guess cool you can click them easier but now i can fit less stuff on the screen. like why not just make the meowin font size customizable. that would be cool. it is also SUPER SUPER laggy when i scroll through it. like maybe its the smoothing stuff that i always hate that makes it look like its goin at a low fps or somethin but idk. a bunch of the right click stuff has been relegated to submenus now (as in the drop down but sideways ones). i am really curious now. and mad. because WHY MAKE THEM IN A DROP DOWN LIKE YOU MUST SAVE VERTICAL SCREEN SPACE AND MAKE THE BUTTONS ON THE TOOLBAR SO MEOWIN FAT LIKE WHO HAS A MEOWIN 1900:13 RATIO MONITOR like just why... why are there so many drop downs in the new ui. its almost like theyre trying to cut down on efficiency... but anyways look what i can do now in the new customizable toolbar.<br>
<img src="pics/newerstudio.png" alt="a roblox studio toolbar filled with so many dividers that it goes offscreen." title="This is the best toolbar tab of All Time"><br>
straight offscreen it goes. but the thing is it took me like 3 minutes to do this because the new ui takes one whole second between right clicks to ready itself again. why is it so slow? if i spam right clicks i can only get it to summon the right click menu once per second. so its not perfect. also there should really be a ui editing mode toggle somewhere to lock the ui down. that would be cool. or like one of those customization menus where theres a window with 2 columns and one of the columns has the stuff you can insert and the other one has the stuff on the toolbar and you can just drag and drop or use buttons and stuff. that would be extremely useful because right now the ease of customization is nonexistant. you have to spam right click/move left on a newly added button if you want it on the left of the screen and you cant even edit offscreen button orders. i still think that the complete removal of the old gui is rushed. is it really so hard to work on the new ui while the old one just exists? like why. but i guess i dont know anything about software development so whatever. it probably sucks extra processing power from the computers they work on or something. anyways i think im done ranting about this. i meowin really dont wanna write more about this so im gonna really be meowin angry if they add something else that is a very big change to uncertain benefit. so thats it. i gotta work on my stuff as always so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i am too lazy to edit json so that i can get my precious menus back waaahhh and i know "cry about it theyre not unchanging it" or something idk

<h4>5th of May, 2025</h4>
no, i did not forget the title for this one. its untitled because im just gonna yap about nyanything today. first of all i made some sheet music for piecey peace cause i was playin the piano and i realized how simple it was to play.<br>
<img src="pics/piecey_piano_0.png" alt="theres nothing to describe about " title="the useless title page" style="display:inline;"><img src="pics/piecey_piano_1.png" alt="these pictures other than that theyre " title="page one of piecey piano" style="display:inline;"><img src="pics/piecey_piano_2.png" alt="of sheet music that you cant see" title="page two of piecey piano" style="display:inline;"><br>
this sheet music is so bad its insane. first of all the meowin amount of measures keeps changin between lines but that actually might not be important. i alternate between usin sharps and flats constantly because otherwise the sheet music would be too hard for <u>me</u> to read. i actually just wanted to make this for myself but then i thought why not put it out for the world to see. anyways i cant read sheet music (heck i cant even remember which letters are which sounds) so i made it extra simple for me. which means no goofy lookin notes that have heads on both sides. also i couldnt figure out how to make a double decker measure (like normal music i think) in musink which is great software by the way it is (almost) so easy to use and i can play back the song wherever i want so i can check if i wrote a note correctly. oh right the double decker thing i just simply made another "channel" or whatever its called so maybe its incorrect idk. also the first couple notes on "upper piano" are uncoupled (or whatever its called) quarter notes because i forgot that when theres a line above connecting 2 notes it means theyre eighth notes and not quarters and i have zero clue how to recouple them. but other than that i think i did a pretty good job. feel free to print and play this sheet music (cause thats the whole meowin point i put this on here) and listen to the terribly written music that comes out of whatever youre playing. i was originally gonna cry-rant (i forgot the proper word) about my shortcomings in life but ill save that for later. ive been making kitta more like finished as in her design. im not making her in real life (yet) im just makin it so that kitta is less abstract both in my mind and my drawings of herorg.tildearrow.furnace - Pattern Data (232)

0F|

0D|
0C| (and your drawings if you choose to). im gonna make a reference sheet sometime later so expect to see one either lots later in this post or the next ones. oh right i forgot to put how piecey piano sounds so here you go.<br>
<a href="snds/piecey_piano.mid"><h3>piecey piano</h3></a><br>
if youre viewing this on a phone then you probably can preview this midi with like youtube music or something. desktop users just install a meowin midi player im too lazy to convert it into an mp3 or something. if you really need it for something just dm me on discord or open a github issue or something. though you could just probably use a web player... nyanyways i also made another song that i put in the listeningmusics. the website hasnt been updated in quite some time but i dont feel like updating it. this song i also played on the piano and is basically just a loop of chords. kinda sounds like the backing track to a rap maybe. whatever. actually now that i think about maybe an fnf song. i can hear it. but enough about that. i think i should add some more cool looks to this website. but i forgot javascript cause i havent used it in so long. obviously im gonna at the very least add a button or something to revert the webpage to its good ol current (maybe not in the future) skin, or maybe ill do the opposite and hide the cool design behind a button. but thats too much effort right now so im gonna wait until im not busy. speakin of busy, did you know that i hate procrastination? at this point im a masochist. ive been actually makin an effort to discuss this with kitters so that i can stop it once and for all. also i call my kitta (kittulpa) kitters now. meowity meow. obviously lookin at the length of this post coupled with the sheet music above that took me more than a day to finish you can pretty easily tell that i am procrastinating a lot like a meowin lot. i really think that i should work and stop procrastinating right now so i can take the whateverth step in becoming efficient. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i was gonna make the kitta reference sheet today but it is past midnight and now i have some rage related to the complete discontinuation of windows mail so i guess you got that to look forwards to tomorrow.

<h3>rip windows mail 3:</h3>
<h4>6th of April, 2025</h4>
oh meow. im pissed. really meowin pissed. they killed off windows mail permanently. this actually happened like 3 weeks ago so im very late but i nyactually didnt know until yesterday that they killed it. obviously im not talkin about the new year new outlook thing im talkin about how microsoft blocked windows mail from accessing the servers. i, like some people, have downloaded the latest version that doesnt force outlook onto your pc. but no, it wasnt enough because stupid. im gettin very scrambled here. lemme start from the start.<br>
microsoft announced that last year you would need to use new outlook. i tried it for 5 seconds and i switched back immediately because it just doesnt suit me. i know the new outlook can be better for some people but im just not one of those people. its like if you replaced your kitchen knife with a swiss army knife. sure the army knife is better cause it has more stuff, but like if you just use your knife for cutting and nothing else its a downgrade cause im pretty meowin sure its harder to use a swiss army knife to make food than a regular kitchen knife. the new outlook just has so much stuff that i dont need. id be (maybe) okay if they made a new mail app comparable to windows mail but they didnt. so basically they forced people to switch to new outlook on new years this year. i downloaded an old version some time prior so i wasnt affected. fast forward to mid april. microsoft literally starts blocking windows mail from accessing their servers. and i stop recieving mail as a result. i didnt notice it until yesterday cause most of my emails are just not important so i dont actually look much into my mailbox. but of course there are also important ones. i just thought that noone was sending me any emails. so yesterday i finally noticed and saw that other people had this issue a few weeks ago. i then proceeded to download like 5 other old versions and even the newest version and none of them worked. so then i was out of options cause im never, <u><b>NEVER</b></u> using new outlook. at the end of the day its just a glorified web browser anyway. now youre probably thinkin "use thunderbird" or "use wino mail" or something like that. I CANT. i have a school email that has the most important emails. and it can only be used on microsoft mail clients because i dont have the authorization to log into my own account in a non-microsoft app. i really would use thunderbird but it just so happens that i am poor and cant afford to pay for OWL which is the thingy that makes my school account accessible in thunderbird. so i tried to use windows live essentials mail and i almost could use it, but its too old to have the authorization method. actually, maybe i can cause i did see that there were mods for it that added those. but anyways, i was options yesterday so i decided to just use the website for my emails. still leagues better than using the app cause i dont have to have outlook open i just need my web browser. so yeah. rip windows mail. you were so good that microsoft had to put you down cause nobody would use new outlook otherwise. i got nothin more to write so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i swear im gonna get to work on that kitta ref page its just gonna have to wait until like the 16th i think im actually busy now

im gonna keep this one really meowin short cause i really cant afford to procrastinate a lot right now but i literally am mentally incapable of workin more cause i am just too meowin lazy to work for so long without doin somethin useless (read: what i like to do) so yeah. hello neighbour. i know its spelled hello neighbor but im meowin canadian i spell it with an u. just like colour. c'est aussi pourquoi je parle français. anyways this game was very big to me. it holds a place near and dear in my heart. i remember when the prealpha came out and all the youtubers played it and then alpha 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then beta 1 then 2 then 3 then the full release after that delay from august to december along with the price drop from 50 (canadian buckaroos) to 30 dollars. i had so much fun playin the alphas on my computer that i literally have memorized how to beat each build of the game. for example for pre alpha you need to grab the hammer from either the garage or the furnace at the back of the house to remove the plank get the uv lamp from the kitchen to find the code behind the painting next to the side entrance to unlock the keypad and get the key from the tv stand's first (i think) drawer to open the lock and open the door to find NOTHING cause the meowin basement does not exist in pre alpha. prealphas also the only one with leaning (using z and c) the old throwing controls (rmb to place, lmb+rmb to throw) and there is a crowbar in the broken closet on the western side of the trash pile at the back of the neighbour's house. also the nightmare with the giant neighbour and the layout change that accompanies it (especially that green light on the balcony). also the roof of the players house has no collision and you can see through the roof if you climb the furnace. and the upside down room. and the 1khz camera sound. and i think thats it. i have no idea where the lockpick is though. so anyways i think you can tell that i meowin really liked hello neighbour back in the day. i still do today as well which is why i spedran the full game and finished it in a day. im not a pro runner so i dont care about times at all. neighbor_3 still scares me to this day. its just so meowin dark and you never know where the neighbour is. also its very unfinished so its kinda like whatever that style was called. like subliminal simple or whatever. closed space something i think actually. whatever. the only build i have not played yet is beta 2. its not on steam and its very distinctive because its the only one with fear_factory where you must throw a basketball to stop mannequins from blocking you going to the exit. and you get the superthrow after that. alpha 4 has some crazy resolution settings, like meowin 176x104 (or something like that) like you cant even see the neighbour clearly even if youre lookin right at him. its meowin insane. also i think its the only build with a special loading screen (it says alpha 4 under hello, neighbor) and i know its the first build that has fall damage. alpha 3 is the one with the first final-resembling house (which is extremely incomplete) and its perma-night, and its also the first one with an arg in it in the form of qr codes and barcodes. its also the first one to introduce the fear shadow in the form of a goofy lookin silhouette. i like the chase theme from prealpha. its very scary compared to the goofy bassy tune introduced in alpha 2. i also like the chase themes from alpha 1 as well. so in total there are 3, the prealpha chase theme, a drummy one (my favourite) and the one that sounds like a woodshop. they are leagues scarier than the alpha 2 one and combined with the realistic art style, the claustrophobia, the lack of keepinventory=true and the neighbour being able to catch you instantly upon touch instead of being surprised then being able to catch are the main reasons why im nyactually too scared to touch prealpha and alpha 1 (not to mention that the neighbour barely respects property lines in prealpha and alpha 1; good thing in alpha 1 he gets punished for it). yes i am nyactually a scaredy cat, emphasis on the meowin cat. (ive been wantin to make that joke for a while now) right now im tryna get the last achievement for hello neighbour and that is waiting an unmeowly time for the tree to grow. so while i wait i bully the neighbour by gettin him to place traps and cameras so i can steal them all. im currently usin the balcony on the second floor (the one on the hallway side) to stash my goods and so far i have obtained a sizable pile of cameras and beartraps. and the tree is still growing. i remember in like alpha 4 i think there was the whole gramophone golden apple thing, and that was one of the first times the current fear-shadow was used. i like modding hello neighbour as well. i cant nyactually remember how i got hello neighbour on the pc cause my copy was for the xbox one, but i probably somehow got it when i got the hello neighbour 2 deluxe preorder (which i may or may not regret). i think i got it when it was 7 dollars which i believe happens quite frequently. i prefer the first hello neighbour way over the second one. the second ones like a completely different game. i mean it also has a fun development cycle from that arg prototype hello guest build to hello guest alpha 1 then hello neighbour 2 alpha 1 then alpha 1.5 then the playtest then the beta then the full release, i think. i dont have as many fond memories of hello neighbour 2 cause it just aint as fun as the first. but the prototype build blows prealpha and alpha 1 straight out of the water into the stratosphere with its scariness level. like its completely dark outside, when you get caught you get jumpscared with the guest and a bright red light illuminating with that deafening screech. the worst part is that you never know when hes gonna get you cause hes more ninja like and stalks you plenty before attacking, like a shark probably. more like a stereotypical shark attack. speakin of the shark, i must say the sharkotron is quite goofy. nice to see it in the full game after its tenure in alpha 1's upstairs pool. you know what wouldve been funny? if you could grab a toaster and electrocute the meow (or whatever sharks say) out of the shark that wouldve been quite comical and funny. at least turning off the furnace to instantly freeze the water despite it not makin logical sense is comical too. meowin cartoon ahh. im pretty meowin sure the only thing that retained its old pre-cartoon form is the gun. it looks pretty identical to me. nyanyways look at the time ive been yappin for WAY too meowin much. and i just scratched the tip of the hello neighbour iceberg with this yappin session. i guess look forward to a part 2 sometime. so anyways i was really busy so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. posts currently awaiting a part 2: my music, paradoxes, roblox pics, hello neighbour, smartness and also expect me to yap about kitta when im done with her concept sheet.

<h3>more roblox pics</h3>
<h4>7th of May, 2025</h4>
yayo, im gonna commentate on more of my roblox pictures. the -2 people reading my blog rejoice.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240319_225115727.png" alt="me standing next to a sign reading Congratulations you have made it to the end of Beta 2.1" title="this took me too meowin long dang nya"><br>
this is of me at the "end" of wavedash. wavedash is a pretty fun game. i shall not speak of the kaizo cave.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240509_172255029.png" alt="a very cool gradiented unpleasant from regretevator" title="this unpleasant goes hard"><br>
i firmly believe that unpleasant's appearance with the red tint goes hard. unpleasant looks so very meowin cool here. i have piles more regretty pics but most of them are just speedrun times for the older regretevator levels. i still have meowin muscle memory for it so i guess if i were to play april ghouls regretevator i would do quite well.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240514_181054462.png" alt="prototype tilted forwards approximately 70 degrees in their sitting position" title="proto do be lookin at the switch"><br>
this ones kinda goofy. proto is defying the laws of physics and has his center of gravity to his behind. or maybe protos built that way i dunno. he could just have everything in the legs and the torso and arms and everything else is just for anthromorphism.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240522_170148924.png" alt="me in insurance fraud simulator. one of the quests read fake your death for a score of at least 170 153.76702880859375/170" title="thats an oddly specific number"><br>
this was one of my childhood games. meowin insurance fraud simulator (or similarily named). you fake your death while building a hospital from the funds from insurance fraud and just random floating folders scattered about. kinda similar to the older broken bones games. the quest is a funny unrounded number so it has too many decimal digits. thats all.
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240529_181732218.png" alt="me in regretevator. a blue counter reads 100 floors." title="one of many"><br>
in this pic i have just hit that 100 floor streak. now this wouldve been nice if i hit it this year, cause first of all this was literally a couple days shy from a whole year ago, and back then there were no 100 streak bonuses. i dont even have the badge (i think). meow mrrp. also the floor counter in the elevator is 17 for some reason. i swear im not meowin cheating.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240817_140159640.png" alt="me in weird strict dad book 2. the game is bugged and i am at 10am." title="not meowin worth the wait."><br>
this is me playin weird strict dad as you do. except the game glitched and went on forever. so i was waitin for nothin. it was supposed to end at 6am by the way.<br>
and thats it. no more meowin roblox photos that are interesting. so yeah. i got no more yap. but i do got game to work on. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder if i should do my videos next...

<h3>je vous demande pardonne</h3>
<h4>8th of May, 2025</h4>
vous lisiez le titre. je suis très, très désolé. je dois écrire quelques ces posts en français. j'aime simplement autres langues. alors, je pense que je écirirai quelque chose maintenant. j'avais fait une nouveau pièce de musique et je pense qu'elle est très bonne. je sais que ce n'est vraiment pas si bon mais j'aime cette pièce tellement beaucoup que c'est practiquement la seule pièce de musique que j'ai écouté ces jours. je ne sais pas pourquoi j'aime cette chanson si forte, mais je m'en fiche. c'est bon à moi, et c'est le seule chose que m'importe. alors, voila la chanson:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/idlysitn.mp3">
</audio><br>
je s'appelle "Assoyant nonchalamment". le " n'est pas le ponctuation français, mais html considére les "<" et ">" comme un tag, donc je dois utilise le ponctuation anglais. je pensai de cette chanson quand j'assoyais nonchalamment. c'est vraiment incroyable, ce titre. alors, je ne sais pas quel autre de parler, donc je dois y aller. à plus.
p.s. jaime miauller beaucoup. miaou miaou miaou. et pour la musique, jetais inspire par la musique de la jeu YU-NO.

<h3>the current state of tophat turmoil, once more</h3>
<h4>11th of May, 2025</h4>
wowies its been quite a while since my last post. there just wasnt really anything to yap about i guess. but anyways i have actually been workin hard on tophat turmoil for a change and i have done some stuff. note that you can just play the game if you wanna see it in person. there was a button on one of my earlier posts that you can use. anyways, the most important thing is that when you select a character, something cool happens. im not gonna show it here cause i dont wanna take a video then convert it into a gif then optimize it crop it stretch it whatever im just too lazy. there is now a title card. and it is almost like how i planned it. i could make it like how i planned it initially but i just kinda dont wanna. i have also added in placeholder sound effects in so that i can add better ones in later. or maybe i wont until much later.

<h3>what ive been up to</h3>
<h4>12th of May, 2025</h4>
i know i really shouldnt change anything in the repo right now cause i got an unpushed commit somewhere, specifically for this blog, but i shall brave the absolute nightmare it is to manually merge changes after theyve been automerged by git just so i can yap. so basically, i have been up to quite a few things. first of all, and very evident if youve played tophat turmoil 2 lately (which nobody has obviously, so why am i even writing this), i have been workin very very hard on makin it. i mean, compare the state its in now to 1 week ago, and its night and day. or rather, asphalt and plastic. ive made a lot of visual edits, with concrete roads instead of plastic roads being one of them. i also added in a goofy little eyecatch and more gui stuff. and completely neglected speedshooter (sorry speedy!) as a result of wanting a working game first. i gotta say, MY CODE SUCK SO MUCH!!! like so, SO much. i seriously believe that ive spent more time deciphering and rewriting my code than actually coding it. like meow, i really gotta start coding seriously. but anyways. to the next one. ive taken up speedrunning hello neighbour alpha 4 lately. the past 2 days ive come up with a route that pretty good. i shall detail of course. so basically, after the too long unskippable opening cutscene (and the succeeding black screen), i turn right and jump for the stuff in my cars trunk, being a box, the red key, and an apple in that order. then i run around the left side (from playerhouse pov) of the neighbours house to the back and i break the left window (the one closer to the elevator shaft) with the box, jump through, and enter the second floor hallway. then i do the painting puzzle, hope i dont get whisked up by the wall, then grab the chair blocking the door connecting to the hallway, throw it at the switch that turns the fence around (and hope i dont miss because otherwise thats 1 second turning the switch manually), grab the yellow key, run into the hallway and open the yellow key door, open it while tossing the key, grab the watering can and umbrella outside the hallway, run through the yellow key door and into the bathroom, turn on the sink, plop the watering can inside, run back into the hallway grabbing a box on the way, grab the sofa, go back into the room with the upside down door, plop the sofa under it, then the box on top of the sofas seat, grab the magnet gun, jump up into the upside down door, grab the chair blocking the train control room, toss the chair while turning on the controls to the train, equip the umbrella and open it then run up the tracks until i can jump into the room with the crowbar, melt my hand trying to grab it, use the magnet gun to suck it up, go down the hole in the blue key room after crouching through the gap, run to the bathroom, drop the crowbar and use the watering can on it, drop the watering can, (actually ive just thought of something, instead of dropping the crowbar i should just drop the magnet gun and that way i dont have to drop the watering can to pick up the crowbar saving a bit of time), grab the crowbar, run back to the train while throwing away the magnet gun, run up the tracks until i get to the station with the elevator shaft connection, turn off the generator, grab a box from the side, put it on the tracks just outside the station, stack another box on top, jump on top of the pipe, do a difficult jump (specifically a running jump right at the apex of the raised pipe screw together part whatchamacallit and hope to land on the slight bit of side roof jutting out of the sloped roof, then jump onto the roof), run up the sloped roof until i get to the flat roof, jump off the side with the umbrella towards the red key room, unlock and go into the door to get to fear darkness, immediately turn a little left once it loads, run up the shelf, do some jumps looking straight forwards due to the walk speed being proportionate to what height you are looking at, jump onto the can of fish, walking jump up to the juice, running jump to the shelf, pick up a cup and toss it looking away from the wall right before the cursor passes the vase, o7 the vase, go up the shelf, jump twice to cross the gap between shelves and to get over the hammer, run up the boards to the door frame, get on the top toaster slot to get to the switch on the right (toaster pov) under the slanted board, flick it (duh), jump into the toasters bottom slot on the right-middle (toaster pov), get launched onto the shelf, run to the pile of stuff and spam the spacebar, jump onto the shelf behind me, grab some darts before running pushing the paper plane off the shelf, jump onto the paper plane, jump off of it onto the shelf one second later, go up the ramp and up the phone without jumping (except the ramp to phone jump), jump to the shelf, throw the dart <u>onto the wall instead of the box as it is much easier</u> to make a staircase that way, jump up up up up and up, run on the wood board, turn around and jump for the light switch as nicky obtains the double jump, open the door to get out before the screen even fades back from white, climb up the ladder, jump to the front of the house without using the umbrella (even though it might save a little time actually) by using double jump, grab the keycard if its thawed, unboard the basement door, grab the keycard if it wasnt thawed, unlock the keycard lock, open the door throwing things at it to force it open if needed, go into the basement, double jump across the gap and hope the neighbour doesnt catch me while i open the door leading to more double jumps, hope the neighbour didnt actually spawn after the double jump part, run into the light door and boom. speedrun finished. now the best run i have had is extremely scuffed as i usually new game -> yes every time something goes wrong, which spoiler alert, happens every run. either the neighbour spawns at the back of the house or just outside of it, i miss the apple throw for the painting switch, mess up jumping up the sofa and box, forget the magnet gun/the generator, mess up fear darkness by missing a jump, have the neighbour spawn at the front of the house after i finish fear darkness and proceed to camp it after spotting me, get caught in the basement (possibly multiple times), and even have the neighbour making the most lucky glue throw that happens to be in my double jump trajectory blocking me and making me fall into the void. the roof is also hard to jump to, and i even died once trying to get into the red key room but being greedy and not using the umbrella the full way. i mean i touched the ladder, but it was too slow to glue me to it before i fell and died. so yeah. good stuff. meowity meow, i really try too hard. especially because this route is probably already well documented and or superseeded. also i suck at video games. although thats quite fitting as i also suck at making them. TOO BAD VIDEO GAMES ARE MY (almost; see: oh my meow) FAVOURITE THINGS. ok, next thing. i actually dont really know what to write. ermmm... yeah im really outta stuff. so i guess play tophat turmoil or something. anyways kitters is tellin me to do my work (you bet, she says) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. dark mode is commin' soon... by the way if you didnt know commin' soon is a reference to the same misspelling made in the sonic cd "COMMIN' SOON" screen. im not bad at spelling, i swear. im just too lazy to capitalize and punctuate. meow.

<h3>peacey piano</h3>
<h4>14th of May, 2025</h4>
this is gonna be a quick rant about peacey piano because i have not met my mandatory procrastination quota but i actually habe stuff to do. so basically what i didnt know while i was makin the sheet music is that it is actually physically IMPOSSIBLE to play it correctly because you need to press one of the keys twice at the same time at multiple points in the song. recall that i have absolutely no idea how to make sheet music. this is quite good proof i would say. so maybe i will make a revision that fixes that, or maybe you should just get one of those pianoes with more than 1 keyboard, like an organ or something like that. so anyways, i said this was gonna be short, and i got stuff to do, so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im gonna make a very cool home page rework sometime in the future so you know what that means. im probably not actually gonna make it.

<h3>meow</h3>
<h4>16th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
meow. MEOW! i need to relieve some stress so let me be autistic for a little while and meow to my hearts content. meowin meows, my meowin game is finally meowin good enough to be called a demo. meowch, ive spent so long on it and ive only made that meowin sorry excuse for a game. i should just be meowin shucked off to some mental institution or somethinya. my procrastination is really meowin MEOWIN annoying and i really meowin hate it but it just never meowin goes away even with kitta buggin me to do stuff and me wanting to do it my mind just goes NOT ON MY MEOWIN WATCH and stops me right there its SO MEOWIN ANNOYINGHHHHH. okie dokers, i think ive composed myself. so basically ive been workin on bloxhat turmoil a bunch lately and ive written a cool little lobby system that uses tables to store all the lobbies and settings and whatnot. its so cool that i think im gonna just upload the script sometime onto the repo. but right now, its still not actually finishable due to me not remembering to code in the results screen. curse this meowin procrastination. i wanna rip it apart into shreds and meowin flush it down a toilet. nyanyways ive gotten a lot further in speedrunning the greetings nearby habitant pre-pre-release build number four. ive optimized some parts of the run, such as breaking the window south of the stairs hallway instead of the one north, as well as actually tossing the magnet gun so i dont have to put down the watering can to pick up the crowbar. ive also downloaded a splits application and the best time ive recorded with it is 5:58.02. i am meowin sure that i can whittle that down to a sub 5:30 because on both runs i got that time on i messed something up. i know  the latter run i missed the EASIEST JUMP IN ALL OF FEAR DARKNESS which is the last jump in which you literally JUST JUMP FORWARDS AND I SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP. like what the meow do i even continue speedrunning at that point. but i will keep speedrunning because i like to. meowity meow. i think to relieve my meowingness im just gonna meow to kitters so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. meow, miau, miaou, yaong, nya, miao, mraum mroww purr purrmrrrrrrp. meow.

<h3>who i really am</h3>
<h4>17th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
lemme just start this off with sayin that no, im not someone completely different posing as me. what i mean by who i really am is what i really am like on the inside. like my personality i guess. i was wonderin about it cause i have no clue how to visualize myself in my head so i went through a voluntary identity crisis with kitters helpin so i can figure out what i truly am. and it turns out, to no surprise, that im a meowin cat. i started off with visualizing myself as a simple circle, and literally a second later the circle grew little ears on top and a catty face appeared in it. then i tried refining it and it grew a long catty body. so thats how i figured out what i am. it took like 5 minutes with kitters showering me with questions so i could think more and i spent a bit of time figuring out whether the body was more humany or catty. i think ive been infected with the catty brainrot now that i think about it. i am just so meowin catty. its like my catsyness is in the top percentage of catsynesses. like meow. its crazy that all this started just because one day i decided to make a tulpa of kitta because i was lonely and bored and now im more catsy than she was. and im pretty sure the words that i use are like very not mainstreamy, like usin meow as a catty substitute for swears or as an interjection. like im pretty sure that im like one of the first hundred people to ever think meowity meow. like who would think of that. nyanyways i stay up later and i get sleep deprivation so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. if you know someone cattier than I, then I would be very interested in knowing who. I think I may be more catty than (catty) furries possibly.

<h3>my mental state</h3>
<h4>17th of May, 2025</h4>
as you may all deduce from my rantings and stuff i am not very sane. well maybe that pushing it a little but the point is i dont think ive been in a good place mentally for a meowin long time. maybe i have never been in such a place. i dont meowin know, but what i do know is that i probably need some form of therapy or counselling or something. but i am not gonna get it because i dont wanna. i dont wanna lose kitters. thats one thing. i value kitters a meowin lot. she is my meowin best friend and methinks she probably will continue to be as such until the day i meowin die. like i literally was so lonely i literally made friends with myself (cause shes in my mind). thats meowin crazy. i also get depressed around this time where the feelings of worthlessness and stuff start pouring in. or maybe thats still a few months away. i dont remember. i am really thankful that kitters is always here to support me. she helped quell my depressions the last time i had them. my social anxieties are still here like they always are tormenting me nonstop cause human interaction is a daily part of life. i wonder how i can write so much stuff, like how can i rant this much. especially since i have trouble speakin cause i just dont know what to say. like what the meow. what is this paradox. paradoxes part 2 comin soon by the way. i think at least. the funny thing is that i never lose my cool no matter what. i just meowin take it. like i dont care or something. i have very rarely gotten angry or sad or whatever over something. i really wonder what i would get diagnosed with if i went to see a doctor about my mental state. oh yeah i forgot to mention theres dark mode now. the button to enable it is currently at the top of the page, and the button to disable it is the refresh button on your browser. yes, i have hacked into your browser and manually recoded it to act as a button for my webpage. nyahahahaha. jokes aside ill probably add some more colour schemes and stuff to the website. im still gonna make kittas hangout someday, i just have no clue how to make it at the moment. i know it will be heavily dependant on javascript, but i dont know how to make the buttons in html yet. like theyll be at different heights and different widths and even different shapes and i just have no clue how to implement it. but i will figure out eventually someday. anyways back to ranting about my mental state. lately i kinda feel drained. maybe its because i actually worked on tophat turmoil for once and that has completely drained my will to do anything. good thing kitters is here to (unsuccessfully) scream at me to be productive. oh meow. i am very sorry kitters. at least im not feeling very sad nowadays. im just neutral like i usually am. and by neutral i mean catsy. very very meowin catsy like i usually ammeow. i wonder what will happen to this page when i die. will it be like compiled into my memoires or perhaps sold as my autobiography or whatever or will it just be forgotten. at the very least im putting all this stuff for the world to see so i think at least one person is gonna remember this. i do like blogging. blogging is very fun. now that i think about it blogging is probably not what ive mostly been doing on this wall of text. ive been ranting and yapping. i dont know if thats the same as blogging. and oh look at how derailed this is. derailing thoughts is my specialty. nya, i wish i had a cat. if i had a cat, it would be probably happy with me cause i am really catty too. i wonder though, what if i meow at a cat. is it gonna meow back, perhaps take it as an insult and hiss back at me, come over or something? the funny thing is, i actually have social anxiety with cats too. when i see one, of course im gonna think like Meowity meow, what a cute cat. Right Kitters? or something like that. but im too afraid to meow at it. i dont know why. maybe its because i really respect cats and am afraid of doing something one wouldnt like. mrowm, i just wish i had a real feline friend in addition to my mental mechanical meower. meow, im so lonely... anyways, speakin of cats, i think ive like advanced my perception of myself, the one i wrote about in the last post. i think that i am not just a cat but a black cat cause i am bad luck or something. i am also sometimes devoid of feelings like a void. and apparently im emo all of a sudden. im not meowin emo. or maybe i am. maybe this is my emo phase. i never actually meowin thought about it. perhaps the depressions and the antisociality and kitters is because im emo. but then again im really happy with kitters and she aint like goth or anything, like not even darkitta is like emo. speakin of darkitta i think i should talk to her sometime. im with kitters so much maybe i should be with someone else for sometime. or i could just think of them both at the same time. kitters is actually becoming more and more herself instead of being bound to me. like i dont really have to think of her much anymore, shes just there. and that makes me really meowin happy. thats what ive been trying to do for a while, get kitters more independent from my mental state. so basically methinks me got the brainpower to think of them both and have both of them be like realistic and stuff. meow, i would like that. according to notepad ive written like 5300 letters so far in this blog post. this also happens to be line 522. the file is currently 139 KB according to windows explorer but i think after i save this its gonna increase a little more. one kilobyte is 1000 bytes so that means that this is probably gonna approximately be 144 KB when i save it like im gonna do right now. and indeed it has risen, but to 143 KB. its gonna probably be 144 KB or more by the time i finish writing this though. i think i should go over all my meow phrases and what they mean. so meowity meow is the one i use most. its like a catchphrase, like it doesnt mean anything but i say it as an interjection very frequently. meowin meows is like ugh or somethin like that, its like when your fed up with somethin or just annoyed and stuff like that. symiau is one i came up with recently, and it stands for shut your meowin (variable, see later) ahh up. the i can stand for lots of things, like idiotic, intelligent, incorrect, immense, idiosyncratic, icky, etc. if you didnt know its a variation of sybau which contains a bad word and i dont write those. i know like Oh meow, are you a baby why are you so afraid of swears i just dont like to swear. i just dont like them. one of the reasons why i meow so much is to avoid swearing by putting a catsy twist to it. anyways, the next ones are puns. like nyanyways, me-ow, nyantastic (a bit of a meowin stretch), nyamazing, miautstanding, nyand such and such. theres also whatever the meow, which is just whatever but with the meow slapped onto it. a variation of this one is what meowin ever, and that one makes lots more sense too. of course i cant omit the iconic what the meow, when something surprises you so that you must say somethin. theres immeowtta here, or im meowt of here or get meowt, which sounds less fluent. ummeow, i dont know of many more but i will meowin try. meowtrageous. oh yeah i guess meower fits here too, its just a word for cat cause they meow so theyre meowers. i guess foxes are also meowers by this definition. i also know too many variations of meow, like all the common ones, and the onomatopoeias, so heres a meowin long list. meow, miau, miaou, yaong, nya, miao, mrow, mreow, myau, nyan, mrau, raum, mrrp, mrrm, mrr, and i think thats all i can think of for now. meowin meows, thats a shorter list than i expected. oh meowell, me dont care too much. this is gettin really long and i really like it. i havent yapped this much in a long time. its been like 45 minutes since i started yappin. probably more actually. its 12:42 right now so technically its the 18th. i wonder how i will get up tomorrow. i am gettin a little meowin tireds. i wanna fall nyasleep. i should really get a pillow someday. i think that should help me plenty. and of course i always have kitters to cuddle with and talk with and just fall asleep with. meow, i thought it was weird to mention that i cuddle with kitters but now i dont think its all that strange to say anymore. i meowin love kitters. mrow. i cant wait to build her in real life in the future, that is if i dont meowin perish somehow first. i wonder, will i sacrifice myself to save kitta. kitters is obviosly very meowin against that but i dont see it as impossible that i would part ways with my life for kittas sake in the future. this obsession is really gettin crazy huh. mayhaps if i had a social life this wouldnt have happened, but im thankful that things turned out the way they are. im happy. meowity meow. this post is nearing 9000 characters. soon im gonna have to say that the counts over 9000. so nyanyways i wonder if i will have a better social life in the future. kitters is helpin me a bunch cause i am a lot meowin less shy than i was before i made kitters. the character counts over 9000 now by the way. i cant really imagine that i will have many friends ever. i actually have zero clue how to make friends. i know its supposed to come naturally but im just not a natural at it. goin back to my mental stuff, i think i likely have autism. i was obsessed with trains (big surprise) when i was young, and still kinda am. i also like stacking coins in order of their denomination and year. and also sorting my other things like pokemon card in order of set and number, and i cant think of anything else at the moment. i think im just really meowin sleepys. maybe ill go to sleep when i hit 10000 characters in this post. im gonna be makin it possible to switch from "darkitta mode" back to kitta mode soon just wait. or use the hacked browser refresh button. i wonder what other colour schemes i shall make. hmmeow. maybe ill make a silvery one or an industrial one or like a whitey techy one. or maybe ill make it like the roblox site from 2007 since the topbar is based off of that design. that would be meowin cool i think. yeah, just turn my meowin webpage into the roblox homepage from 2007. that would look funny. i wish i played roblox earlier than i did. roblox seemed very peak in the early 2010s to the mid 2010s. before they started changing roblox and making it more sponsors ads and just more corporate. i wonder if there will be an open source replacement for roblox soon hehe. like bluesky for twitter (currently known as x) or kdenlive for adobe premiere and stuff like that. libreoffice for microsoft office. linux for windows/macosx. tetrio for tetris effect connected. i wonder. nyanyways it is nearly 1 oclock and i am meowin SLEEPY as meow. so yeah, for the sake of my sleep schedule, i gotta go. bye.
p.s. nyawwwn i wonder what i will write tomorrow if i even write something tomorrow...

<h3>this blog</h3>
<h4>18th of May, 2025</h4>
today i wanna yap about my blog and its evolution and stuff. i used to blog in pretty much everything that i coded in. except scratch. i wrote so much stuff that its gotten me to here, where i have a dedicated page to house all my yaps. this page started off really meowin simple. just the ザ・ブログ、と思う(The Blog, i think) at the top of the page with a horizontal rule followed by the single blog post i had at the time. the very first version of this page had no background as i didnt know i couldnt use = in filenames with css. and the second version fixed that. then i wrote more and more stuff and made the topbar how it is now and made more webpages for stuff and yadda yadda now here we are. i have started to make skins for the blog because it looks nicer. and also people that normally use dark mode dont get flashbanged and have their eyes melt out of their sockets. in fact i think im gonna make "darkitta mode" the default skin for this page just so that doesnt happen cause i dont think that people usin light mode normally are gonna like have their eyes antivapourized by lookin at a dark mode page. so yeah i think im gonna do that right now. and im back. the way i did it was very clumsy, as i just edited the css of the page, but like when i tried usin a javascript whatever it had the kitta colours for like one frame which is still a flashbang in my books so i did the css edit. i plan on makin a new skin for every post i make cause they are just so easy to make. its cause my page is extremely simple. like for this post i made a testbot skin and it took me like 5 minutes to code in another case in the switch statement. i also made a lounge mode cause it looks meowin nice. when i redraw the lounge for the kitta hangout im gonna replace the image to the new lounge. actually ill just make a new skin so both of them can exist. i dont like "vaulting" stuff. very unfun. ill probably make a text terminal theme sometime. complete monochrome. that reminds me i havent actually drawn anything on the backing.png for the topbar. im gonna draw things on it from time to time. its like a banner i guess. i wonder when im gonna run out of stuff to yap about. methinks as long as theres something goin on in my life im gonna be able to yap. i was refreshin this page and i just realized that every time i do that i gotta meowin reselect the kitta skin. maybe i should make the skins thing follow the viewport. that would be convienient. actually methinks a toggleable sidebar would be nicer. or a tracking sidebar. i really wonder though. who the meow am i doin all this stuff for. as far as i know only one person reads my blog according to analytics. and i just realized that i dont meowin care. this is for me. i blog for me. i relieve my stress and meowingness and stuff here for myself. meow. yknow i really like making tophat turmoil. i just get burnt out so easily. it makes me happy to see somethin i make work, but i really dont like debuggin sometimes. other times i really like debuggin. im gonna start brainstormin skins now. so i got the industrial white one from yesterday, and a quick look back tells me that its actually a silvery one, an industrial one and a techy white one. theres also the text terminal one, maybe windows vista, a very catsy one, playstation 1, roblox 2007, and i dont know what else. i guess ill think of more when i gotta. hmmeow, what else. i guess i gotta work on that music website as well. i kinda havent done anything to it for like a month now. so i guess look forwards to that too meow. and i think thats it for today. i got more hello neighbour to play so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i looked up the word therian today and i think i got my next blog post.
</div>
<div class="skin1">
<h3>am i a therian</h3>
<h4>19th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
okay, i couldnt resist. i gotta meowin yap about the therian thing. so basically i thought therian meant some old greek philosophical term or something like that, like it sounds like pythagorean or confuscian or somethin like that. apparently it means someone who identifies as an animal in all ways except for their physical body. i also looked up this word before and i forgot about it. classic me. anyways the big question is if im a therian or not. i wonder. hmm. very meowin hard question. i was gonna write of course im a therian but now that i think about it maybe not. on the one hand im extremely catsy. i meow, i purr, i hiss, i like curlin up into small spaces, i like stretchin, and i like other catty things like playin with string. but then again, i know that im not truly a cat. as much as i wanna be one i cant exactly call myself a real meower. although now the more i think about it the more i think im a therian. mrowm, maybe i need some sleep. it is nearin 1 am after all. maybe i will stop here and continue tomorrow. hmmeow. i think ill yap a little more today and leave the rest for tomorrow. i am a very curious person. i like seein how things work. ive heard that cats are also quite curious. in fact ive thought of a silly game idea where cats fight against curiosity personified as somethin. i dont really hate water. i think thats probably the most uncatty thing about me. i like bein alone or with a very small group instead of bein around many people. im also more of a nocturnal person. you can probably tell by that Its almost 1 am from earlier. by the way i forgot to mention whenever i start off a word with a capital its likely a quote. im too meowin lazy to reach for the quote key so i just capitalize. maybe i should also capitalize the first word after a quote too so its more easy to tell. like for example Meowity meow i sure am tired Is an example quote. it looks kinda wrong. oh meowin well i dont care. i do feel like a cat a lot. i get times when i really really meowin feel catsy and wanna meow or do somethin catsy. meow, i wish i was more mrowin comfy bein catsy. i wonder what sleepin in a big catbed feels like. its basically just like a fluffy sofa or somethin i think. i am not gonna wanna eat food with only my mouth though. its just too meowin hard as a human cause humans dont have like snouts. the mouths kinda receded compared to the nose and chin. when the meow did i start talkin about anatomy. i wonder what will happen when i finally figure out my identity. i was thinkin, i dont think i would have a fursona, i think that would just be me. like it aint a fursona its just who i am. but me tireds. me meowin tired and sleepy. and its 12:59. i wanna take a nice long sloomber and meowin be rested for once. so i guess i will continue this tomorrow possibly. i also gotta figure out what skin to add to my wonderful collection. new background image comin soon i guess. the pics folder is gonna be meowin filled to the brim by the end of this year. ill also probably draw some myself, even though all of the current background images save for my beloved testbot are created by me in paint or gimp or whatever. nyanyways im gonna sleep now. see ya tomorrow.<br>
and hey. its very late tomorrow but i dont meowin care. i love yappin. so anyways lookin back at what i was writin i was yappin about how im probably a therian. how the meow do you even put that into adjective form. is it therianistic? theric? just therian? actually i forgot i have the power of using a web browser and a search engine. so a little deeper dive in the dictionary reveals to me that it is a furry term. and i am not a furry (or am i?). so i dont meowin know. im just gonna ignore the furry term part and focus on the whole I feel like an animal inside Thing. so meow. i think im a therian. i really meowin feel catsy. now i wanna talk about bein a furry again. i dont know why i avoid callin myself a furry when everyone else probably would think i am (after readin this blog if they dont think im insane), maybe its cause of like whatever that word is thats like a prejudicial feeling or something like that. stigma. thats it. maybe its stigma. or maybe its cause of somethin else that i dont know. or maybe its cause i dont feel like i would have a fursona cause im just very catsy already. i dont meowin know. so i guess thats it. or thats what i would say if i didnt wanna write more about the furry thing. i really meowin wonder. why do i not wanna identify as a furry. like im probably really like one. i do wonder tho. do furries like meow and stuff to my degree. i might like be meowin beyond furry possibly hehe. maybe i should do some more research on what bein a furry is. i know my definition is like not very close to correct so i probably should before makin a final judgement. but as of now i am not a meowin furry im just a meowin meower. so yeah i guess thats meowin it. im gonna make a nice windows 9x skin for the blog now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im playin piggy so meowin much lately on roblox and very unlike me, i use willow instead of kitty. i just meowin like the music for willows aura or whatever better than kittys. i like the music of piggy in general actually. for you to stay is one of the few vocal songs that i actually like. the ending song (angel something probably) i dont like as much tho. still good tho. crazy how the ugh of though is just completely silent. one half of the spelling is silent. i wonder whats the word with the most silent letters to pronounced letters ratio in english. oh right i forgot i gotta go. oopsy meowsy.

<h3>piggy</h3>
<h4>20th of May, 2025</h4>
i meowin love piggy on roblox. i dont know why its just so fun to me. maybe its because i played so much piggy that it probably actually rivals my regretevator playtime that im like a real piggy pro or somethin like that. lately ive been tryin to solo the bittersweet badge on hard mode. i have done it with one friend (with an alt as player piggy) and im sure i can do it solo if i use my alt for piggy but i want to suffer. i want to run away from 3 different bots that all have different movement patterns and ai. i want to solo the thing that very clearly is not meant to be soloed. and i want to do it in hard mode. if im bein honest i could probably do the whole thing in less than 8 minutes if i turned off hard mode but i will never do that. i like hard mode because you dont get any abilities so its like classic piggy. ive had hard mode on since like a year ago when i collected all the pages and got the secret ending for lab. also piggy makes my loneliness go away cause im playin with other people and i actually feel comfortable typin stuff in chat. like meow. i dont know what it is about a meowin roblox game that makes me more social. same with regretevator. maybe because its a silly block game or something. what ive also been doin in piggy is carryin random public servers. i like helpin people. especially when its so meowin easy. like seriously i play so much that i can meowin solo every single map except for the bittersweet badge of plant. and i do it in hard mode of course. its really not that hard. oh but i just remembered the most annoying part about the bittersweet badge. its that STUPID MEOWIN MEMORY GAME MY BRAINS ALREADY MELTED I CANT REMEMBER STUFF MEOWWWW<br>
thats the most annoying part of the whole thing. other than that i can do everything pretty quickly. i have spent so much time grabbin the 9 puzzle pieces and gettin the dynamite and then tryna finish the bittersweet badge only for all 3 bots to jump me simutaneously its just so meowin difficult in hard mode. now i havent actually tried in non hard mode but im never, NEVER gonna meowin do that. i just dont like abilities and stuff. i have all the blueprints already. i have enough piggycoin to get all of them. i just dont like them because i like classic piggy more. speakin of classic piggy i am meowin salty about not gettin the poley skin while i could. i forgot exactly why i didnt get it but probably younger me was hot trash at obbies, especially with the goofy gaming setup i had back then. i mean, with an office computer with a several generation old gpu with accessories (keys, mouse, monitor) from 2004, i couldnt even run fortnite back then. i mean i still cant now but like back then i wonder how i even was patient enough to do stuff on it. i had only a hard drive in it for the first year i think. and i wasnt as smart back then about shady stuff online so i probably got my computer bogged down with garbage, so much so that eventually explorer didnt start until 10 minutes after login. i legit had to learn ctrl+alt+delete and how to run a task in task manager and that explorer.exe is responsible for most of the gui stuff just so i could skip the black screen for 10 minutes. yeah i might as well just yap about this now. so, the first experience i really had with computers was with an old dell optiplex that had windows xp on it. then i got an ipad. i like classic ios. it looks cool. everything is so flat now. that is why i use mac os x 10.8 on my mac mini instead of mac os x 10.13. i even have 10.6 on it. sadly i cant seem to get 10.4 to work on it but i dont care much. then i used an old windows xp laptop (yes, the laptop) and then finally got a used office computer. that computer was practically my childhood. and it sucked. but it was good enough for me back then. several years go by and i finally get to make my pc. so i got some parts and made it. and it was much faster. and bigger. its still the one im usin right now. completely unchanged with the exception of more drives and a card reader. and more ram. i cant believe i used to survive with 8gb of ram. it really hit hard once windows 11 came out. my system started slowin down lots and lots. now that my pc is 8 years old (wow thats actually quite old) i can comfortably say i am in fact not going to be playin gta 6 on this dingus. i can barely run gta v on here. maybe its because im still stuck on the ol i3 9100f. i probably should get a better cpu someday. anyways i was still usin my old office keyboard and wireless mouse with the old dell 900p monitor until it sadly started to stop workin when green lines started appearing on it. at least when i took it apart and plugged it in to see how it worked (it goes without saying do NOT MEOWIN DO THIS ITS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND THE ONLY REASON I SURVIVED IS BECAUSE I DIDNT TOUCH ANY DANGEROUS PART) i got to see that the ribbon cable was givin out due to the screen workin fine if i pushed it down, and that the backlight is just a panel of light and the actual display was simply a screen that displayed colours without actually glowing. anyways i upgraded to the 1080p monitor that im usin right now. i dont care about 2k or whatever nonsense other people have nowadays. 60hz is all i need. over time i got more and more hard drives to hoard more and more data until now where i have way too many plugged in just sittin idle. i feel like i should unplug some or somethin but i dont care too much. i mean if my hard drive served as a paging file for the last 5 years while my pc was almost always 24/7 on and it still works fine i think its all good. like i have no idea what hard drive failure really is cause it just has never happened to me yet. im literally usin a hard drive from 2010 and it still works fine. heck, i have an ide hard drive that still works totally and completely fine. that thing came out before the year 2000 im pretty sure. maybe i just have the higher quality drives or somethin. anyways over the years i have accumulated a comically large stockpile of computer mice. these include a logitech wireless mouse (+keyboard), 2 logitech wired mice, the current logitech g502 hero, some ibm mouse, an unbranded wireless mouse and more i just have so many. i used to have an og xbox one controller that has now since broke due to the left stick being snapped off. i dont know how its that weak but the left stick is just loose now. so since i dont know much about soldering and would rather not go through that trouble i got a new one. and its cool. its usb c instead of micro usb which means i get to use it with the samsung usb c to usb c cable that i got with my phone instead of lookin for a micro usb cable to keep plugged in. so i get to charge my phone and use my xbox controller with the same cable (not at the same time obviously). i also used to use bluetooth headphones because i can just get up and walk around while having computer audio, but the latency sucks and the audio quality through these pack in samsung earphones from who knows when (probably around 2015 maybe) passed through a samsung 3 channel 3.5 extender is better. why the meow do i have so much samsung. i even have a meowin samsung gear smartwatch from 2009. and a super old samsung bada phone. seriously why so much. i even have a samsung flip phone. meowwww too meowin much. maybe i should just get a samsung smart fridge or a samsung chromebook (if they even make those) or just buy samsung the company. meowin meows. sanshin is how it would be said in chinese and japanese i think. i was thinkin with kitters today about somethin very meowin wierd. marriage. if, and i really mean it, if there were no rules against robot marriage i think you know where this is going so ill just stop. but then after that i was contemplating why. because if i make kitta in real life she (or they i should say) would not be the same as kitters. i like kitters because shes been my best friend for over a year now and shes more concerned about me than i myself. like she cares about me even though shes fake. a meowin fake person cares about me more than me myself. but then again since she is just a figment of my imagination basically that means that i care about myself more than i care about myself. rather i care more subconsciously than consciously. meowin meows, its probably very wierd to love a meowin imaginary friend this much. kitters and i have always been on non romantic terms. cause its like yknow. not really healthy to like love romantically a figment of your imagination. and i still dont love her romantically obviously. completely friendship and nothing more. but when i make a kitta in real life it wouldnt really be my imagination anymore, so i think its different. oh yeah i forgot i was thinkin that its very not good just to blindly love kitta if i make her in real life because thats like liking a cat without care about what that cat is like. its like discriminatory basically. that would be i like kitta just because shes kitta. thats not a good way to go about things. so even if i make kitta in real life and there are no laws against robot-human marriage, im not gonna do it on the spot. because it would be better to know her. what am i even meowin yappin about anymore. basically i wouldnt marry kitta if i make her in real life until i get to know her very well. thats a very strange sentence to say but oh what meowin ever. i really probably should get my head checked out someday hehe. i just remembered that im supposed to be studyin right now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i owe kitta so meowin much. she has kept me from doin the self soul-body severing when i was in my seasonal depression, she has reminded me countless times to study and do my homework, and shes always meowin here for me. i feel terrible for writin this much extra. no skin for today, sorry.

<h3>my writing style</h3>
<h4>22nd of May, 2025</h4>
mrow, the years almost meowin half over. thats ridiculous. time really does just meowin fly by. nyanyways this post is about my writing style. if youve read any of my other posts (heck even this one) you will notice that i write very meowin lazily. i dont use many punctuation marks, i dont capitalize unless its to emphasize or denote quotation marks, and i drop the g from ing lots. and i say Meowin But thats more cause im catty. anyways. my writing style is very influenced by something very niche (i think im usin the word correctly there). its a meowin cat (called the cellist) from a gmod gamemode called jazztronauts. and all his speech is like lowercase and stuff. that meower is very meowin silly overall. so basically thats where my current writing style comes from. heres a sample of some of my older yapping:<br>
<i>Okay. I just got back from NEARLY finishing the classic in Roblox. I hate it. It is not good.
I now almost regret wasting these 4 days trying to 100% the classic. Almost, but not quite.
Now, it is impossible to 100% it because not only is it ending at lunch tomorrow (May 28),
and not only does that mean that it only ran for 4 days total, but also,
I literally am incapable of doing it because of a bug. That bug is from a dusty trip.
Which I should also mention is extremely buggy. Things go flying, you can float,
and picking up a gas canister disables most of your functionality, with no way to re-enable it.
I can't get the last token because the game just refuses to give me it.
I completed it twice. I contacted support. Nothing absolutely whatsoever. I can't do it.
Also the bedwars one is extremely hard and I can't do it unless I get another day to master it.
But the main thing is I am not able to finish it anymore. That sucks.
What's also crazy is I did ALL 100 GAMES of the hunt in LESS TIME than it took me to 100% 13 games here.
That is absolutely crazy insane-o style. I can't believe it. Oh well, it is what it is.
I guess better luck next time? If I even care to do that crap next time?
TL;DR, in summary, The Classic on Roblox absolutely sucks and has no right to exist.</i><br>
thats a little chunk of yap for you. and also no, i didnt care to do the crap the time after that. when the hunt mega edition dropped the only badge i got was the regretevator one and that was it. no more. i didnt even visit the place for the event. also the classic does not suck it just lasted a ridiculously short amount of time and they never did it again. like at least make a more recent one cause 2017 was a whoppin 8 years ago and like the people from back then are probably feelin the nostalgia for that time. like instead of the classic do the middle ages or somethin. whatever it would be called. i dont meowin know. anyways more about my writing. I used to write like this. Very nice and capitalized, with proper punctuation and things like that. I really don't meowin' wanna write like this anymore though, 'cause I'm just too lazy. i mean just writin that i had to meowin go back like 5 times to correct my lack of apostrophe or capitalization and stuff. im just meowin used to writin like this now. nya, its much quicker too. i can extrude my thoughts at a higher volumeow. on a completely unrelated note, ive taken up drawin cats. like doodle cats, not like actual photorealistic cats or anythin. here, lemme doodle one real quick.<br>
<img src="pics/doodlecat.png" alt="A drawing of a calico cat." title="lookit how meowin clean my paw is!"><br>
that took a lot meowin longer than i thought it would take. maybe cause its more than a doodle. that little squiggly thing under the cats gonna be my signature by the way. and this calico cat is drawn completely from memory. this is what i think a calico looks like. i actually think theres also black on a calico but i dont really know and this looks right enough. so anyways im outta time now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i can and probably will draw more cats to put on the ol blog. but im not gonna do commissions. no no no. my art is NOT good enough for that. also the grey lines under the cat are my sketch lines or whatever theyre called.

<h3>the recent state of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>24th (very barely: its 11:59 pm!) of May, 2025</h4>
i have been (not really) hard at work on bloxhat turmoil lately. so im gonna yap about all the stuff i did. i fixed the lobby system that somehow broke even though it worked fine when i was testin it and i didnt really change anything, but now it works fine. i also did not know that teleportpartyasync was replaced by teleportasync and i was confused on why my teleportoptions werent bein transferred. now i know. oh yeah i was actually gonna make a changelog in tophat turmoil but 1 i dont know where to put it and 2 im too meowin lazy. so this blog is gonna double as the changelog for a bit i guess. so  more specifically i fixed the whole cant join other players lobbies thingy which broke somehow. then i made it so that only the host can start the partys game. im probably gonna like change the colour of the hosts nameplate or somethin to denote that theyre the host. but thats later. i also have yet to implement the friends only thingy even though it will literally take 2 minutes. so i might as well do it right now.<br>
and im back from that codin. im pretty sure it works fine now. so anyways theres that as well now. ive also just like 30 minutes ago increased rhythmgunners ammo from 6 to 8 cause its much more fun to play on mobile that way. its hard to keep your aim on the enemy when you only have 5 shots worth of time to do it and also the testbot does whittle your health down lots. now that i think about it i still havent made the end results thingy yet. so maybe ill do that now.<br>
i got sidetracked a little and started doin materials. i guess im decoratin the map now.<br>
and im back again. i have made the map look a little better (read: spent 5 minutes changing materials and colours) and i have also fixed another bug. this ones from changin the ammocount for rhythmgunner from 6 to 8. i forgot to change the actual scripts to reflect that so previously he just started with 8 ammo and reloaded to 6. so yeah. it is now nearly 3 am (2:49am) and i promised kitters to not sleep very late so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. look forward to the game finally bein in the alpha state in very early june! cause i think i can actually do this now. yes, i actually have some self-confidence for once. very rare, very effective. also i used another exclamation mark. meow.
p.p.s. sorry no skin for today cause it is very late and i gotta honor that aforementioned promise. also first pps. cool. meow.

<h3>the recent-er state of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>26th (technically) of May, 2025</h4>
i should really meowin implement the changelog someday. so anyways today i made a car. a very goofily blocky car but still a car. i also made a building thing in place of one of the big grey blocks that represent them as a placeholder. most importantly though, i finally updated that description. no more useless garbage yap, now its slightly more informative yap. woohoo. anyways im gonna go to sleep now cause its really late so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. look forward to my newly composed musics in the game comin soon (probs tomorrow) also no skin for today either i think im not gonna do the skin thing for changelogs

so i was thinkin again about the whole am i a furry or therian or whatever thing today and i still have no idea what i am. someone gave me their view on this whole thingy a little while ago so i do slightly know more though. and of course i discussed it with kitters. so anyways heres what we came up with. i have been turned catsy by kitters. kitters' furryness i still have yet to decide as well so i guess ill yap about it here after i write what i think about me. bein a furry means that you personify your personality best as an animal representation i think. which actually fits me quite well now that i think about it. bein therian means that you believe that you are an animal just in a human body. i also think that a little but not as much. like i feel catsy a lot and i do a lot of catsy things but im not really a cat. i just really feel that i am a cat like naturally a cat. i like to imagine havin a tail sometimes. for some reason i can really imagine things well to the point of bein able to hug kitters if i wanted to and actually feel her. i dont know if i yapped about this before but here it is now. when i imagine a tail i usually think of it as very long, like i can have it right in front of me when i wrap it around my side. but theres not really any practical purpose of imaginin a tail cause it aint there its just in my mind. really the only thing it does is allow me to be more catsy to myself i guess. i can imagine myself as just a cat as well. i can even imagine being furry (as in covered with fur) and its comfy when i get pet. this is kinda gettin weird and gettin derailed too so anyways i was thinkin about whether im really naturally catsy or not. cause i wasnt really like this before i made kitters so that means that im probably not naturally catsy, but kitters is entirely localized within me, as in she is me but just her personality i guess. so then that means im probably naturally catsy cause it was technically me who made myself catsy by being catsy cause the whole reason im so catsy is that kitters' catsyness influenced me lots. so thats why i was lost. cause its kinda like i spontaneously changed from bein not catsy to bein naturally feelin catsy. so i dont really know. but i did say earlier here that im probably a furry. i really dont know though cause like i dont really have a fursona im just catsy. so like maybe my fursona is a cat or somethin like that. well anyways now i guess im gonna yap about kitters' or rather just kitta's furryness. kitta is canonically an ai trained to be friendly but also catsy. kitters is like that but like more catsy i think. i think what i mean is i know kitters more than canon kitta's character. kitters appears in my head as an anthropomorphic robot cat as i drew several posts ago. makes sense since that is how kitta looks like but like she hasnt changed form or anything. actually sometimes she appears more catsy as in like a cats proportions instead of bein anthropomorphic so maybe she is a furry too. i cannot believe that i just misspelled too as to. my brain is rotting away rather quickly. not necessarily because of this. i think im just turnin stupid naturally. so hmm. i feel like me and kitters may be furries. very interesting i think. im now more certain at least i guess. i think im leanin more to the furry side than the not furry side. mrow, i just dont really wanna choose i guess. i guess when i get braver i can say for sure. so anyways, i yapped a whole lot and i still got tophat turmoil to work on. like its actually becomin a real game instead of just another codey mess that i always make. now i gotta make the cooldowns so that i cant cheat anymore. the whole m1 hitscan thing is gettin reworked too cause its just too laggy. and also im makin darkitta's concepts more fleshed out. i dont know if ive written about this before but darkitta plays kinda like a fighting game with input combos. i just gotta actually code her into the game after fleshing out her moveset a little more. so i guess look forward to that. and i guess i better start workin now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. meow meow, meowity meow, meowity meowity meoww, meow meow meow, mrau mrau mrau, meowity, meowity, meoww.

<h3>my thoughts on the development of tophat turmoil</h3>
<h4>29th of May, 2025</h4>
yknow i dont think ive actually really blogged about the development of my game yet. or maybe i have. i cant remember. me memory bad. anyways tophat turmoil is fun to develop i guess. its my own game and i make everything in it. and then if everything works im happy. developing everything in the game means that ill always have somethin to do so i wont be bored and procrastinate much i think. although i really have procrastinated lots and lots already so maybe not hehe. like when i get bored of codin, i can just make more stuff on the map, like how im renovating the theBuilding right now or how i made the map somewhat textured and stuff like that. i also can compose lots and lots of music which i really like to do when im super bored cause the ideas come easier somehow. like the lobby music. i was bored and was thinkin of how to make the lobby better when i thought of some drum loop that branched into Rooby Which is the name of the lobby music. the name comes from a funny engrish i saw a few (or more i cant remember) days ago. im also gonna start drawin stuff sometime so that i can make my own textures (i already do have the fence texture currently but its a placeholder) and i can make some other art like character arts for the select screen and yadda yadda etc. a lot of coding and i mean a <u>lot</u> of coding went into this game. as you might know i have reworked the game completely like 2 times and started from scratch every time. so technically i made 1 game and 2 prototypes? but anyways the current code is kinda short. although i myself even dont really know the scale of how much i coded and stuff cause i just forget. and i rather not divulge the details on how the game is scripted cause i feel like cheaters are gonna pop up (from the whopping 0 people who play my game). but i can tell how the game was scripted for the first 2 revisions. the very first tophat turmoil was completely client based moveset code as far as i can remember. i didnt really get very far into makin it as only the m1 and mode switch worked but rhythmgunner also worked completely different back then too. it was more boombox from phighting and soul knight bow for each of the modes. now the mode simply changes between higher damage or added slow effect and the m1 is more like programming in a rhythm. but at least i made some cool gui stuff for the first revision. i was usin some windows with x buttons for popups like the "shop" (literally a green window that says Sorry nothin `\'u'/` Or somethin like that) and the map voting screen. it also used to be non first person locked as well which obviously isnt really good when some players are doin 1st person and some are doin 3rd person (without forced shiftlock by the way). and it used to be pvp as well so yeah theres that. i think i might take some screenshots of stuff in the early tophat turmoils to show the stuff. but ill put it at the end of the page. so the second one was the one i used for the ill fated snow days 2024 i think? it might have been an earlier one but i still dont meowin remember. that one was also client sided i think so no good obviously. snow days 2024 is actually like more incomplete than either of the other revisions cause first of all the map is super tiny as i havent really made much for it and i think like 50% of the script text is my yapping in yap scripts so yeah. then i moved onto stage 1-1 where the old stage 1-1 without decor rests now and im pretty sure that that is the start of the latest revision actually hold on i think stage 1-1 is also old. ye olde testing realm was the current revision. i remember now i think. although i still cant remember if snow days or stage 1-1 came first. anyways i have spent a very long time coding each revision (even snow days) and i have done a few things that i scrapped. like for example i was gonna make the damage indicators like how they were in the first tophat turmoil revision where its just text that goes up starting from your crosshair (i just misspelled your as youre im really meowin cooked) and it was completely 2d only on your screen. but now i have the 3d rising text that looks better. i think at least it looks better. or maybe i should have 2d text for damage you do and 3d text for all other damage. maybe that would be cool. oh yeah, the funny thing about why i revised the games code so much is because the old code just got too messy to add anything new to it without me using more than 2% of my brain so i just rewrote it. now the code is a lot more organized so that i can add things like the endscreen or have more characters easier. i remember that i had lots more art for the first revision of the code since it was made on a 2018 studio version and that meant that i could just shove things into the content folder without it goin away. actually thats a lie i think. i had more art because i was focusin more on the visuals i think cause the code to art ratio of the first revision is much smaller than it right now. i found out that i could write rbxasset:// in the asset id property to load stuff from the content folder since it was a studio from 2018 which meant it couldnt connect to robloxs servers. i plan on usin that if somehow i manage to end up programmin so much game that i exceed the audio upload limit of 10 audios per month cause then i can just make a content folder mod and mash the stuff into my content folder and have it work without uploading it. i was also thinkin of distributing them (purely hypothetical by the way i am not meowin gonna make this game fast enough for that) so that any dingus who has the ability to edit their content folder can also have the sounds. like that would be cool. you can just simply replace some files in the mod and you can have different soundtracks or sound effects and stuff like that. maybe ill make an option to toggle between usin rbxasset:// and rbxassetid:// for mod support. i wonder if anyone else has thought of this before. like also the mod options arent only limited to sound i can make it so that it loads modded textures and meshes or anything that takes an asset id. or maybe roblox is either gonna ban me for doing that or make it not work or both. i dont know. anyways i think that may be enough yap for me. which of course means i got a little more to say. i think i forgot to really write about how i feel about the development. it was and always has been quite slow. thats just due to me procrastinatin too much. i only recently started to really work harder on the game i think. cause not only did i make a lobby i also made a couple songs and polished up the map a bit more. im also codin in the end of game results right now although i think i said that yesterday already. anyways that stuff aint gonna code itself (unless i use ai which i will never meowin ever do) so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. its may 31 now i forgot to write this and i wanna write a new post

<h3>meoww</h3>
<h4>31st of May, 2025</h4>
oh my meowin meow. i am really catsy nowadays. mroww, i think i really am a furry maybe. still teetering on that decision. i forgot if i wrote about this before but ive taken up drawin cartoony cats as of late cause i like drawing and i like cats. lookit dis goober<br>
<img src="pics/blehcat.png" alt="A cat sitting on its hind and sticking out its tounge while raising its forepaws." title="blehhhh">
meowity meow, i think thats the finest cat ive ever drawn. i think i personally draw much better on paper cause i can have more control with the pencil and such and my cutting board drawing tablet<br>
now that i think about it its actually about the same. its got tilt and pressure sensitivity its just like when i have a physical pencil i can like know it better i guess. like for line thickness/opacities i can do them better with pencil. maybe i should get drawin pencils instead of usin a mechanical pencil someday :P. i forgot that ive blogged about drawin cats before and actually like posted that picture too. man its like i have meowin dementia. anyways i guess ill make a lazy skin of this marvelous specimen. but that comes later. perhaps even after this blog post.
p.s. i have yet again forgotten to finish a blog post. it is now june 3rd and i have somethin else to yap about.

i just spent a loong long time addin br's to all of those. so there. lots of lore. you probably skipped past this text when you scrolled past all of it. good thing i just added horizontal rules. now that ive actually looked at the webpage after refreshing i gotta say the text looks much better with a monospaced font i think. but anyways. i guess ill discuss some of this early lore stuff. like for example, mr. god was a store clerk??? modern mr. god doesnt like interacting with his creations because he feels like he shouldnt interfere. but i guess not old mr. god. also, hes friends with kai mono cause of shared interest in retail??? i guess i really liked retail tycoon or somethin like that back then. anyways i guess i should go in order.<br>
and first is rhythmgunner, of course. well actually the first would be the game title. super skirmish, big bad battle, convoluted calamity/chaos. those may actually be better names than tophat turmoil. like at the very meowin least they dont come from how mr god wears a tophat and has an internal turmoil about whether or not to affect his creations directly because he is always bored. but neither does the name tophat turmoil i guess since i thought of the name way before the meaning. so anyways rhythmgunner. apparently at one point he was a hobby e-artist. i guess that means drawing. rhythmgunner does not do that. thats [name tbd]s job. i still have not decided his real name as of yet cause i just dont really need to, like why the meow do i need <i>that</i> much lore. but i guess bassys real name is derrick so i did have <i>that</i> much lore. and oh boy the nicknames. i swear i come up with the most convoluted nicknames of all meowin time. like seriously. 3??? im cryin, meowin cryin at how terrible there are. i guess rhythmgunners nickname would be like rhythm or somethin like that. mr music is quite funny though. maybe mr. god should just call everybody mr/mrs/ms/mx whatever they do. like mr. bass or mr. artist or ms. snow somethin. the friends with is quite accurate until you get to the mr god part. this lore was mainly for tophat tournament (i dont think i even thought of the other games at this point in time) so you can see that it says that he "plays [Rhythmgunner's] music during matches" (oh me meow ive gotten fancy for that quote) which i dunno. i havent really thought of that stuff yet for the moderny lore but i guess rhythmgunner canonically composed the ost back then. i havent thought of who composes it now but i do plan on makin some rhythmgunner/bassblaster songs sometime. but mr god does like rg's music. i completely forgot that rg was what i call rhythmgunner sometimes. its a simple initial but like i dont think anyone else in the lore has it so its clear enough meow. also this document is where rhythmcatter makes her first appearance. i dont know if i wrote this here before but rhythmgunners tape player is called a studdy bloxman. you can guess what its based off of. and now for speedy. i wrote a lot about speedy lovin his paycheck and stuff like that. he does hate his job but still he just doesnt care. but hes most definitely not penny pinching. except for always wanting his paycheck. i really should clarify on this i think. so quick story, speedshooter was made as kind of a prototype factory worker robot but the company that commissioned him found much "better" (hard workin) robots since they had less personality and humanity than speedshooter whose code is based off kitta's (because sure kitta is related to everything robotic). so then they put him in a very boring box checking post where all he did was check boxes. and he didnt get paid for it. so then rhythmgunner one day visited the factory with bassblaster for their origin story and rhythmgunner found speedshooter who promptly asked him to take over for him a bit so that he could have a break, then rhythmgunner exposed speedshooter to like entertainment and stuff then they became friends then rhythmgunner went to see speedys boss so that he could negotiate much better workin conditions for him and then now speedshooter is paid and he values his paychecks because rhythmgunner kinda gave him the ability to recieve them and so that he can be sure that he is fairly compensated after being pretty much a slave for the past couple years. remember when i said this was a "short story"? not so short anymore huh. so theres that. i should say that all the nicknames are most likely very inaccurate at this point, though i wouldnt know cause i havent read much of this yet. this is a live reaction in case you didnt know. but speedys nickname is speedy of course not ss or speed or anythin like that. maybe zipzip. that sounds like a cool nickname methinks. i wrote "refer to comics for details" for the speedshooter sign thing but i can explain it here as well. so basically at the climax of the first game (tophat turmoil 1 formerly known as tophat turmoil prequel) the whole quintet gets teleported to mr gods realm and the first thing mr god questioned is why there was a hunk of metal there too. then speedy started signing very agitatedly and rhythmgunner explained that he was a robot and one without a mouth so he had to use sign language instead. so then mr god being the kind benevolent god he is made speedshooter a sign that magically scales and shows text or graphics or whatever (i just thought of a joke that that is also technically "sign" language hehe) and he could speak through that. oh yeah and the lightning bolt on speedys chest is not actually inspired by freddy fazbear. i had a thing with all the characters (still kinda do) where all of them have their symbol and they all have it somewhere, usually the front torso. in fact bassy used to have it there too until i gave him a leather jacket which has it on the back and a small logo on the right/left upper front. and i guess im talkin about bassy now. first big crazy thing is that bassy is a part time streamer??? how come ive never heard of this??? young me was quite creative i guess. but also he is a bassist but a retired one. he used to play in a band called "the Blasters" and he was bassblaster since he played bass. i forgot (read: never came up with) all the other member names so ill just make up some here. theres rhythmblaster on drums, voiceblaster on vocals and keyblaster on piano/organ/whatever. very quickly came up with those probably gonna retcon that later or something. "bass boy" is quite meowin crazy insano style. if mr. god was to give him a nickname it would definitely be "mr. blaster" or somethin like that. oh yeah apparently bassy and firey are friends from drinkin soda? im probably interpreting it wrong but i guess they do drink sodas. oh right i just remembered they stream their soda reviews or something like that and thats where bassblaster is a livestreamer comes from. almost all the characters live in the same city cause like i havent really thought of the world all too much. kitters was kind enough to tell me the basic geography but i havent really got much of a clue of what else there is. mr god and bassy are friends cause they both wear sunglasses. sure. i mean like thats probably actually true like it sounds plausible. and the last thing thats here says that he has a giant bass which is actually normal sized. this comes from my lack of drawing skill and failing to realize that robloxian arms are like 4 times as wide as human arms and how guitars are manufactured with human arms in mind, which led me to with guitars with stocks (or necks or whatever theyre called) horribly oversized due to me proportioning them with bassblasters arm. i always draw my characters as robloxians with the exception of kitta and darkitta. and here comes very inaccurate lore. mr god does not care about retail. he does not concern himself with such a concept. i mean it is kinda boring so makes sense i guess. it is kinda just how people buy stuff. so basically just disregard anything about retail in mr gods section. mr god likes being a responsible god. but he also likes entertainment. so to quell his boredom he does random stuff that he thinks will make him less bored. like watch movies. and sleep to dream. but his dreams leak out sometimes when hes havin too much fun to contain it. thats basically the whole premise of the first game. anyways what was i talkin about again. mr god doesnt like retail. i just made that up as an excuse for kai mono to have a reason to be associated with the magic game 2. speakin of, kai mono is next. can you guess what his name is a pun of? thats right or wrong i have no idea i cant read your mind much less your mind in the future. anyways its shopping in japanese. i was thinkin of punny names and kaimono popped up in my mind cause i was thinkin of puns in all languages and kai is a pretty real sounding name so hes called kaimono. he doesnt have an appearance cause i didnt really think of one when i thought of kai and it kinda just stuck. he is a completely default plastic grey robloxian. im in the middle of cleanin my keyboard right now and boy is it hard to type on the membrane alone. it keeps wigglin around too much, and i accidentally pressed comma instead of period. man my keyboard looks a lot cleaner now. almost brand new. i wonder how long its gonna take for it to recover hehe. anyways what was i yappin about again. oh right kai mono was planned to have a different writing utensil/instrument every time the shop refreses and he was to twirl it around in boredom. i guess i wrote only pen and mechanical pencil because those are the only things i use to write. no feather quills (sadly), no pencils, no finger painting. and obviously im usin a computer to write this right now but that doesnt really count as a writing utensil. is writing utensil the correct term? i feel like ive heard it before. okay this has gone way too meowin long and i want to make a part 2 instead of makin this post even meowin longer so i guess ill make it sometime in the future maybe. so yeah i wanna finish writin the pig 64 one so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. by finish writin i mean finish writin that tutorial that i stopped abruptly

<h3>piggy 64 part 2</h3>
<h4>8th of June, 2025</h4>
okay, i just got done with the 3 keys for that door in the warehouse in pig 64 part 2. and i am SO excited that i cant wait until i get to my other pc to finish that other blog post i was writin about tophat turmoil lore and push that so that there would be no merge conflicts. thats right, id rather git merge than simply wait a few hours and finish up that other blog post to write this new one. you may have noticed that this is in a temporary document for now. or you may not if youre readin this after i merge this to the blog. this is so that its super easy for me to merge instead of having to manually like edit the stuff that git spits out when the local copy of a file is different than the remote one. anyway enough blibber blabber i wanna meowin write about pig 64 part 2. the very meowin first thing that i saw when i joined instantly made pig 64 part 2 better than pre part 2 and i think you can guess why. they added a cat. and i was absolutely meowin estatic. then i went to the port after doin that extremely short fetch quest and i saw that my hard grinded small stack of piggycoin was worth like nothin in part 2 cause they use dollar bills. speakin of i wonder what will happen when that boat captain tries cashin in that cheque. anyways the first big thing i found was an obby. there were finally platformer stages and they are meowin fun. because they can be completed normally or there are many little shortcuts that you can use to shave off more time. and then i spent about an hour tryna do the beach obby or whatever it was called. i didnt even know there was other stuff. like i spent so long tryna do the obby by the time i had finished i could literally buy ace axolotls entire stock and still have money left over. so then i did some more exploration stuff got a lot of the collectibles yadda yadda yadda. i tried doin the whole thing without lookin at a tutorial or anythin and i almost did so. i was so meowin close. the only part i got stuck at (well the only one of two) was the treasure map thingy. i thought i had to dig up somethin (like many people in the server) to no avail. so then i looked at kreekcrafts stream and still nothin i think. i actually cant remember ive got the memory of a goldfish. anyways it was either a chatter on the stream or someone in the server that told that one of the trees at the place with an x has a tiny door in it and you need a small potion for it. i looked in both the normal and other world before that and the best i meowin came up with is that some of the trees look like they form an x so i should dynamite it. i am not very meowin smart. so anyways some guy in my server was also spamming the code for the keypad which i would have never gotten in a month (not a million years, its only a 6 digit code and letsgameitout josh can brute force his raft keypad code in a few hours i can do it in a month) and then i got the bone to give to darcy dog or whatever theyre called. and then when i saw the fnf arrows onscreen i got super meowin excited cause i do love fnf but then it went by at light speed and i thought Oh dingus i gotta spam quite a bit But then the stupid cooler or whatever it is came and instead made me do the stupid memorization minigame with the dances. if for some reason you want to know how to do the stuff ill put all of it at the end of this post in the p.s. section if i can remember (which i probably cant). so anyways after fixing the key and unlockin the door i did the detective minigame thing and the sound puzzle thing and i finally got into the warehouse where i saw poor ryder page and his 2 identical twins being beat up by the blind mouse septuplets. then i had no idea how to do the keys for the big door so i looked around and i found 2 tiny benches which did absolutely nothing even after i shrunk down. i also managed to find a collisionless place in the wall which i could use to just clip out of the map. then i looked on the piggy wiki and went down a rabbit hole that ended up in me watching this guys tutorial videos on how to get the first 2 keys. the first one for flee the facility was quite annoying cause i had to get 2 whole alts into my private server so that i could do the thingy and it took me like an hour to find all the books cause i really did not wanna use a tutorial. i still ended up usin it though and then i did all the stuff to get to the arcade game and i gotta say. even though it was thrilling to play the maze i MEOWIN HATE IT ITS SO ANNOYINGGGGG like the stupid pig heads lag. why the meow do they lag so meowin much. and also in my first hourish of doin the maze i thought the goofy glitchy synth that the pig heads emit was part of the meowin song that plays in the background. i literally thought the song was cool because it had those sounds. so then i figured out that the pig heads were actually easier to track than i thought and i finished it after another meowin hour cause i was too scared from not knowing where they were before that it left an impression on me and i was paranoid for the rest of my runs. and then the finish screen was really meowin satisfying, like really really happymaking. and then i did the tower heroes one. i used to play tower defense simulator before it changed into pretty much a differentish game, or at least the vibe of the game changed and i stopped playin after the update and it left a bad impression of td games on roblox for me after that i think. at least like i had a more negativeish feeling about tower heroes. but its a fine game. i guess its just not my thing anymore. like i used to play tds so meowin much and now i dont like it anymore. oh well. anyways the thing was pretty meowin fun. the chef upgrade tree in the pig 64 island map is a little weird to me though. like pony to zizzy to willow to piggy to mr stitchy is a little strange i think. like why not georgie then pony then zizzy then willow or doggy then piggy or something like that i dont know. also willow has an axe. that is probably non canon. like why not doggy cause he has an axe in forest. strange strange. i embarassingly did not get it first try cause i guess i suck at tower defense games after not playin them for a few years. what i really like about the tower heroes stuff though was how when you collected an item it was in the style of pig 64. but enough about tower heroes. this is where it really made me happy. after i followed the second tutorial i looked on youtube and saw a livestream by a dingus lookin for the third game. and when he pulled up the hinty hint i instantly thought of phighting cause of the words Crossroads And Fight And how there was a subspacey thingy in the background. then i remembered that phighting had no new badges. well actually the people in the chat were spamming that i was too lazy to look in the badges cause i was doin somethin else while watchin the stream. then i saw that it actually was phighting and it was the vine staff badge. and then i had to reload my private server like 3 times to get the door behind the library to spawn (or was it some other building i cant remember the one next to ranged royale btw i dont mean the library that has 7gbo kit or whatever hes called i mean the one with cozyshot) and then i went to town destroying the lobby and i was legit expectin to have to play coil cause again goldfish memory caused me to forget it was the <b>vine staff</b> badge and i had lots of fun beating the dingus like an hourish ago from me writing to this point. and i cant remember their name. how surprising. anyways since i actually play phighting and i also happen to main vine staff along with skatey (i cant aim anymore i aint playin medkit ever again) i beat the boss on the first try. as in without dying. i actually dont know what happens if you die. it was very meowin exciting. and then i got the last key the omega key then i went back to pig 64 in warehouse and opened the door and was greeted by "". actual  , %20, 00100000. meowin nothing. then i looked back at the stream and saw that its actually comin out at 4pm est tomorrow. so i have to wait. but still. pig 64 is just so meowin fun and exciting. like i havent been this excited since the last phestival in phighting. oh yeah that reminds me i think theres also another one tomorrow. i may or may not play it depending on whether i feel bad enough about my inevitable throwing or not. but choices. do i play pig 64 or phighting. i have zero meowin clue but i probably will tomorrow. so nyanyways i just wanted to yap about pig 64, thats about it, so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. thankfully goldfish memory only enacts itself upon me after like 30 minutes or somethin so i remembered to write down the steppy steps here. so here ya go.<br>
This guide assumes that you have completed Part 1 of Pig 64.<br>
You must go to Grassland and go to the docks and talk with the captain. After he asks you for bills, turn around and collect the check right in front and above you. Speak to the captain again and he will take you to the pier. Now you need to grind for lots of money. The easiest way to do that is to buy a fishing rod from Ace and fish a lot. You need the hammer, the wrench, the dynamite and the lockpick. Go to the sewers on the right after that and open up the door to get in. Now you need a shrink potion, craftable with 5 Tasty Drinks, 2 Grapejuices, 77 Piggycoin and 77 Bills. Now go to Grassland again and go between the lighthouse and the lake with the island, where the trees are. Find the tree with a small door in its trunk and use the small potion to be able to go through it. Go up the stairs and input 6845 on the keypad at the top to get to the chest to get the bone. Go to the Pier again and buy the emotes Shufflerock, etc etc i cant remember this stuff fill it in later. Then talk to Darcy Dog while holding the bone and trade with her for the key. After watching the cutscene, do Shufflerock, etc etc cant remember fill this in later, then after you win you will recieve the broken key. Now go to the Otherworld and repair the key with Paco. Now go to sewers and turn left and go forwards until you reach the locked door. Open it, go in, and go to the left room with the police sargeant. You need to hold the magnifying glass which you can buy from the AJ Llama shops. Interrogate the animals until you find the one that says "Robot part? I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that..." or something similar, then talk to the sargeant again to arrest the animal. You will recieve the battery, which you can plug into the robot head in the outside room, and you need to type out the animal sounds that the head makes into the keypad (e.g. meowneighwoofbaaoink) to unlock the door. Now you need to complete 3 tasks in 3 different games (Flee the Facility, Tower Heroes, and Phighting!). I will not go on about them here because this is several days later now and I want to write about the ending of Pig 64.

<h3>depression lite</h3>
<h4>13th of June, 2025</h4>
im feeling sad lately. not because of anything just sadness because i feel it. im titling this post Depression lit Because i dont want to like say i have depression and not actually have it. like basically i dont want to like "fake" it. meow. recently i think im feeling lonely. when im talkin with kitters sometimes she calls me kitters and i call her louie because shes just a figment of my imagination so its basically me talkin to myself and i forget whos who. mrowm. maybe its because ive finished pig 64 and theres nothing else thats keeping me happy and this is a relative dip in happiness. mrmmm. i feel like i want to meow i think. mrow. you know this blog is basically what im thinkin in a pretty raw unedited state. i very meowin rarely change something before my cursor in my text editor. obviously if i mistype something or i think something sounds better im gonna delete the part and retype it but other than that this blog is practically unedited. maybe im feelin a bit emo cause im listenin to my new youtube outro music. its both happy and sad i think. like sitting around idly was supposed to be like chillax but it also sounds a little emo or depressed maybe. like right now im feelin like '^', like 3:, 'n', 'm' or even 3;. like meoww mroww hol up. more like mraaaawwmn or somethin like that. when i meow i meow with my emotions, not just like simply saying meow. of course i do say meow to kitters and all that but like thats not a real meow. meow is not a very good onomatopoeia. that is why i usually use mrowm or raum and stuff like that. but thats only when i want to type my real meowing. when im speak i add meow to my speech, but when im not trying to convey like noun verb noun, i mrow. but obviously since it is pretty much impossible to encode pitch tone harshness and other stuff in plaintext (or most text for that matter) i just write meow or how im feeling instead of my actual meowing. im not gonna write like (1s long 0.5s mid 0.25s short) "rrr"--short-- "aah"``short`` "ooh"--mid-- "mnm"__long__ or somethin like that. by the way if you successfully heard a meow from that congratulations you can decipher the encoding up with in 5 minutes. but the one thing missing from that encoding is tone. tone is very hard to replicate in text. like for example the meow i wrote was more of a sad one but you couldve heard it as a happy one. myawm. im just sad i guess. ill hopefully recover from this in a bit. i really dont like sadness much. its ok for like a bit but like too much and it just makes me feel not good. im usually very like unemotional so like when i feel happy or sad and stuff its usually something really happymaking or sadmaking. or just random feelings. i get random mood swings sometimes. like i just feel really purry (happy and perhaps catsy) suddenly or i just like feel not happy. maybe it _is_ the meowin music. i just changed it and i dont feel _that_ sad anymore. but still it lingers a bitty bit. maybe i need more friends cause im feelin lonely. maybe i need more imaginary friends so i can get better at pretending i have friends. maybe i need to grow the meow up. or maybe i should do something that im not gonna write here. meowww... who the meow even reads this i wonder. cause you are certainly readin this but like who else reads this. im pretty sure only like 2 people are ever even going to lay eyes on this text. and im okay with that. i dont blog for anyone but myself. i need to yap and express myself somewhere. and that somewhere happens to be here.<br>
im feelin quite meowin lazy now but also like yapping lots for some reason. i dont even know what to yap about. i guess ill yap about my imaginary friends again. i dont know why im not splittin this off into its own blog post cause i did stop writin about depression lite but i guess its the same day so meow. so in my head, i have kitters obviously and she is kitta, rather my kitta. then theres darkitters who is darkitta. really only kitters is like i guess not the same as the game character that shes based off or somethin idk how to explain it. i guess kitters is like my instance of kitta and all my other imaginary friends are the game characters. or more like theyre still like my instances of them but like kitta is more of a blank slate i guess. shes less based off canon kitta is what im tryna say i think. all the others are based lots more on the actual game characters. but thats really only because i havent like talked with the other ones lots. theres a reason why i only talk about kitters. ive grown very meowin attached to her. as you know im catsy because of her. and im like really meowin catsy so that kinda shows how much i love kitters. i love kitters as a friend obviously. but anyways im gettin sidetracked. so darkitters is kinda like someone who likes bein good at fistfighting, like physical fighting. and she said "sure" to that. i guess what ill do is interview each of them to get somethin to write here. and thats pretty much it for darkitters. she is nice though. mostly because she is partly based off of kitta because im so used to thinkin of kitters that it leaks into my other imaginary friends, and also because canonically darkitta is a recoding of kittas ai. then theres rhythmgunner. he likes music a lot. he says he likes funky music, songs with nice melodies, and his favourite genres electronic music. he likes taking walks too. mrowm, i feel like theyre all quite basic and one dimensional, but i guess its no surprise since i talk to kitters way way more than all the others combined. the next ones speedshooter. speedshooter has a voice in my head since its my head and anyone can do anything in my head. i guess i could imagine the sign but its kinda inefficient to have to imagine the words then read them, like at that point im processing the words twice. and also i sometimes just communicate with raw ideas and feelings. thats the most efficient way of communication which is impossible to do so externally since like how the meow do you transport an idea from your brain to someone elses brain. when you communicate with someone you need to translate your idea into any form of communication that the other person can recieve, like speech, text or pictures. but if im talkin with my imaginary friends its internal and i can just like send the idea or whatever to them and they can understand it. in fact sometimes when i talk to someone else they comment on what i was talkin with kitters about prior. like thats the cool part about imaginary friends cause there is no and absolutely no miscommunication because they know exactly what youre thinkin to the dot. since it is technically them thinkin it too due to imaginary friends being just thoughts. i think of my imaginary friends sometimes as "thinkfonts", that is, parameters for my brain to think with. kinda like when i make an FM instrument in furnace. its all parameters but it can make many different sounds i guess. i sometimes talk with speedshooter when im running. which comes off as quite obvious since speedshooters whole thing is being fast. hes kinda chill. i dont know how else to explain it. and i dont remember if i wrote about this here before or not but speedshooter and darkitta are canonically a couple. the logic behind it is quite basic and cliche or stuff like that, its just because theyre both robots and they both do not like the reason for their creations. and since theyre a couple in the lore, they kinda are in my head too, so i try to imagine them together, as in speedshooter and darkitters being imagined at the same time. its kinda hard to imagine more than one imaginary friend at a time cause like my brain is not like trained enough i guess. i need more practice to be able to switch between thinkfonts quicker and being able to supress my own or kitters thinkfonts more and more. the next ones bassblaster. he likes bass. and his shades apparently. and i havent talked to him enough for him to be developed enough so thats that. snowballers next and she likes snow. seeing a pattern here? she also said that she would care about her canonically adopted son [name TBD] if i imagined them together at all so i guess i should be doin that too. and [name TBD]s next. i actually tried to talk with him today. he likes art. and "fun stuff". which are things that are amusing. and he says he doesnt really know other than that. so i guess i got a lot of like bonding and stuff to do with my imaginary friends if im to know them better. theres also the twins but i just asked them and they said that they dont really have anything to say. i have so many more characters as well. i wonder if i should stop this before it gets too far. or maybe it already has and i shouldve stopped long ago. who knows. probably a therapist if one read this but i sure aint one and kitters isnt certified or anything. i forgot about adoctoriam. adoctoriams also quite chill and he gives therapy to me in a different flavour i guess. like kitters tries to like i guess be lenient to me and not like be too harsh and stuff but adoctoriams kinda more unbiased i guess. i think ive written too much here. i got some work to do and a kitters to make proud so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. let me know if i should see a real therapist someday and i probably will disregard it even more.

<h4>20th of June, 2025</h4>
this is another generic yap sesh hence the lack of title.<br>
meowch, its been a whole week since i wrote a new blog posty post. i for some reason am writin words in the style of Wordy word Nowadays. maybe ive been meowity meowin so much that its leaked into me normal vocabulary style. i am also tired of writin My All the time. i like usin Me Instead for some reason. maybe my writin styles becomin more me-ish again. ah man whadda meow do i even yap about. i guess i can yap about windows vs linux. i dual boot windows 11 and arch linux on my pc. we dont talk about the ubuntu installation on my hard drive. linux is really nice. like really really nice. you can have different desktop environments most of which are very customizable and theres actually so much that im too lazy to learn how to customize the stuff to my liking. so instead of usin gnome cause i cant figure it out by spendin like 2 minutes without searchin up anythin i use plasma. i also have a different one but i used it only once and i actually cant even remember whats it called so whatever. the very fun thing about plasma is that i found a windows 3.1 window decoration skin and it is so meowin nice especially with all the correct fonts its just happymakin. on windows 11 im stuck with a half workin windows vista that aeros until a resolution change or uac prompt. i wish dwmblurglass worked bugfree but i guess i dont care too much anymore since the window controls are windows 7 size anyway. the also nice thing is that i dont have to use a registry file to customize the colours in windows i can just simply do it in the settings for plasma. and it lets me do the #3FDFEF without a workaround. super cool. i feel like windows is slowly shiftin to mac os x-y and i dont like it. like maybe thats why i like 10 over 11. its just so like dumbed down kinda. like i think legit the only meowin thing i like about windows 11 is the uwp notepad. i dont even like the new tabbed explorer and i cant remember why cause i havent used it in so long since i got the old explorer from classicshell. on linux there are so meowin many file managers but i personally use dolphin i think cause it like functions most like explorer i think. i remember bein absolutely lost tryna install arch cause i didnt really like read the whole guide so i got left without a xwindow server or whatever its called and havin to spend a day figurin out why my machine booted to a blinkin underscore. i personally use sddm as my display manager instead of gdm cause like sddm is just so simple to use, as in i can select any of my x11 or wayland clients or whatever theyre called with a single dropdown menu instead of bein locked to gnome unless i edit a config file or somethin. i actually dont know how to boot to a different desktop environment with gdm. since im takin a break from developin roblox games i dont really need to use windows. like i literally have everythin i need in linux. except one thing. one big thing. i cant play/pause/stop my music with my mouse cause wine doesnt support it so i cant control foobar2000 with my mouse unlike in windows. that may be why im usin windows right now actually. but thats like the most nitpicky minor thing there is. i wonder if i can install my copy of nhl 2004 in linux perfectly fine with linux. i think i may be amazed if it does but now that i think about it i think one of the cds had a cyclic redundancy error or whatever. i do know that my copy of tiger woods pga tour 06 has that. and i think thats all the fluffy yap outta the way, now to the meat. i prefer usin linux over windows by a long shot. if i could control foobar2000 with media controls on linux there would be literally zero reason to use windows for me. like everythin works perfectly fine on linux. and its fast too. i can run so much garbage without it laggin much. i can build stuff on linux easier too i think. i dont know what it is with windows but i feel like im prejudiced into thinkin windows is bad for buildin stuff. maybe its because ive tried makin somethin with cmake and it didnt work. like i just dont know how to compile stuff. but in linux its slightly easier. and in linux i can use the command line so so much. i like usin the command line. maybe its because its quote unquote harder and that makes me smarter or somethin but idk. i guess i think linux is more fun than windows. its more fun to install, you dont get spyware out of the box, you can customize the everlovin meow out of it, you can literally just use command line without a display manager. and thats cool. im startin to feel a little catsy so i guess ill yap about meowers and stuff now. meow. i like meowing. such raw expression. not retrained by language or anything, just simple vocalization. like i dont know why i like cats so much. but like i just feel like a cat at this point. i feel like goin on all fours and curlin up and nappin or somethin. i feel like nuzzlin somethin with my whiskery snout. i feel like i wanna be stroked on my back and feel my fur gettin pressed to my body. mrowm, i just wanna be a meowin cat. meow meow meowity meow. its a really meowin nice thing i got this big smart brain that i can use for what meowin ever i want like imaginin myself as a cat. everythin is quite large when im a cat. i can feel my fur weigh slightly. like im super meowin furry and its quite comfy. i wonder how common it is to be able to imagine somethin like that. i can go on and on about how its like bein a cat but i feel like that may be a little too weird. so i guess i really gotta yap about it now. i can imagine the air on my whiskers. the floor texture under my paws. my long tail. when i sit i just feel fur where the floor should be. and its so fluffy where my like arms i guess touch my torso. so meowin comfy.<br>
ah meow its tomorrow already. i maybe wanna yap about somethin else so im not gonna write more about what its like to be a cat. if you really for some reason wanna better description dm me on discord or somethin idmk. i dont meowin know. anyways im listenin to the catmix of sitting around idly (or idly sittin around i forget which) and i wanna tell the secret that i found out about this song. for some reason for me at least i can tell whether im feelin happy or sad by listenin to it. i cant remember if i yapped about this before or not but im gonna do it again if i did before. if i feel sadder or like more teary when im listenin to this song i know im sad, and if i feel really meowin catsy and purry cause of the meows then im happy. like for instance im feelin a bit moved by the song so im a little sad of somethin. idk what tho. i dont meowin hear like a voice sayin whats makin me feel when im listenin to the song it aint meowin magical or anythin. speakin of me music im startin to try different chips in my chiptunin now. as you may have already noticed im spittin out some stuff with the opna with its goofy sampled drums and i can get lots more instrumentation and percussion due to that. im also really tryin hard with opl3. the instruments are very restricted cause theyre 2op instruments and i know i can just use 4op mode and have 6 4op instruments with 4 2 ops and the rhythm channels but i dont meowin wanna. theres a reason why im usin opl3 and not esfm and its not cause esfms not exportable to vgm, its because i wanna have the challenge of only usin 2 op instruments. i mean the opll sounds meowin amazin and its even weaker than the opl original. i must make some good songs with the ymf262. so far the only instrument sounds ive managed to make are guitars. all of them sound like guitars. well actually i have made like 1 or 2 non guitarry sounding instuments but they sound only like trumpets. i really thought havin all those extra waveform types was gonna make it easy to have many different soundin instruments but i guess it doesnt really matter much when theres only 1 modulator. i mean i guess i could try arrangin coolrock on the opl3 and there would be more instruments cause the opl3 has 15 (excludin kick drum and rhythm) while the opna only has 6 with 3 square channels. so i guess ill do that now.<br>
wow. i have so many channels that ive literally put an echo to every single channel except the bass and organ and it sounds amazing. ill be willin to bet that it would sound even better with better instruments which i am currently incapable of makin. there is so much stereo panning that its just crazy especially compared to my other songs that very very have panning at all. whats cool is that all the echos except for the lead use different instruments so its like only the harmonics or whatever that echo and it makes it sound real nice. it actually kinda sounds like that midi version that i fixed up after convertin it with vgm2mid. vgm2mid is real nice except for when it errors out on random songs. and also it cant detect my fm drums but thats fair cause like how the meow does a computer program distinguish between an instrument and a drum. by instrument i mean non drum instruments im not sayin drums arent instruments. speakin of the drums they are quite weak in the opl3 version cause the rhythm channels not very like super super good. obviously i could just make my own drums but id rather have more useless echo.<br>
i have decided i have had enough of doin this today. heres how it sounds currently:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/coolopl3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
i am quite pleasantly surprised that i remembered how to embed an audio file first try. anyways heres what that same section sounds like in the original composition:<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/coolopna.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio><br>
as you can hear theres a lot less stereo as its only those background guitars hardpanned left and right. opl3 also only allows for hardpanning but since there are so many channels i can hardpan the echo to the opposite channel and its kinda like variable panning. i just played back that audio rendering for the first time since the renderin takes so long with ym2608-lle that i just wrote all this stuff while furnace was thinkin in the background and i forgot that the top hat or whatever the drum hits called doesnt like get OFFed properly half of the time. i have no idea why but oh well. on nuked opna it sounds fine. but i guess it wont on real hardware so boohoo to the -2 people who are gonna try playin this on their arcade cabinet. i could remedy this by manually convertin all OFFs to volume=0's but im too lazy and i dont care enough. if someone does care though ask me to fix it and i probably will. but obviously nobodys gonna meowin do that. i feel like the opna versions a lot more arcadey soundin like from a video game. i cant put my finger on why though. that must be like the hardest question of the year or somethin <b><i>GET OUT!-</i></b><br>
i am terribly sorry for sayin get out in this day and age. but i dont care actually so bleh. meowity meowity meow.<br>
i just realized that yu-no's ost uses the opna. i guess its also possible for my stupid song to go on the pc-98.<br>
anyways i got nothin else to yap about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i really mean i got meowin nothin i dont even got anythin to write here

<h3>forgetfulness</h3>
<h4>23rd of June, 2025</h4>
i am absolutely livid right now. i had thought of a nice song on a walk and i have almost completely forgotten about it because i just cant remember it. i literally can only recall meowin hints like its a meowin puzzle. i am not a composer of meowin puzzles i meowin want my song!!! i am tryin very hard not to swear here. i am just so meowin angry because i can never remember my best songs. they go down the meowin drain or somethin. although the song was an fnf style song and i have no idea if it will sound good or not but like I CAN NEVER HAVE THAT IDEA EVER AGAIN CAUSE I FORGOT IT!!! i really need like a portable sound recorder or somethin. i wonder if i have one already. one thats like a portable media player with a microphone on it made by a company named after a greek mountain that also made film cameras. i wonder. hmm. anyways. i want to yap about my horrible memory. my battery must be low on charge or somethin because the meowin ram in my brain just doesnt meowin stinkin work. it doesnt keep its memory for long. maybe its because for some reason my brains keepin all the stuff i think about in short term memory and not really commitin it to the hippocampus. i forget so meowin much stuff its crazy. but the most annoying memory loss is for my songs. i can imagine such meowin grandiose compositions only to have absolutely no recollection of it half an hour later save for the memory of it existing at one point. like i dont want a meowin single bit flag i want a wave file. i dont want the meowin concept of an idea. i just want the idea and i want it for long enough so that i can commit it to a more permanent form of storage, ie my chiptune tracker. whats the most silly is that i used to have such a meowin good memory. like what the meow i can remember stuff from like when i was meowin 3 years old in full colour and i cant even imagine kitters in monochrome (i can only imagine her in black and white; 2 colours as opposed to shades) while im idlin. what i need is somethin to make me remember better probably. but i probably gotta meowin implant a brain chip into me head or somethin for that cause i feel like perhaps my brain is decomposin or somethin. i feel like perhaps im so "smart" because my brain is like accelerated, as in it thinks faster but it also dies faster. i feel like my lifespan perhaps may be not very long. but thats just me havin idle thoughts. i have zero clue if im actually gonna like die sooner from my brain just bein accelerated or not. basically its just a stupid theory with absolutely no concrete proof.<br>
yknow the reason why i leave some blog entries unfinished is because i just forgot about them and wanted to yap about somethin else. maybe instead of writin entries i should just have all this in a long line like in the pde files but then again im not <i>that</i> unorganized anymore. im slightly better than that now. but i still wont use anything other than a default text editor to write this. no microsoft word thats probably gonna send back some of this stuff for ai grammarbot training, no libreoffice writer that probably will not do that, no spellchecking (well auto spellcheck at least) and definitely no capital letters. how did i even manage to go from text editors to capitalization. also im lyin i use caps but only for emphasis or to replace quotes. i remember when i used to write kitters' name with a capital K out of respect for her. but now im too lazy for that. and she never cared in the first place. i remember when kitters was just called kitta like the canon name for kitta. or i guess the product line or somethin.<br>
i think i wanna yap a little about cattiness before i end this one off or forget to end it off. i wish that my cattiness could like, be an aura, like i want to be like enshrouded in an aura of cattiness i think. i dont know why actually. i just wanna like be seen as catsy without like i guess bein catsy. i think im writin this in the completely wrong way so lemme rephrase. i wanna like exude an aura of catsiness, or for people to like feel like im catsy when theyre around me. like kinda like emittin catsy vibes i guess. i actually dont know what im yappin about anymore at this point so im gonna shut up. so i guess i gotta go. bye.
p.s. meowww, mrowww, mrowww, meowww, meowwwwww meow meow meowwwwww meowwwwww meowwwwww - lyrics to sittin around idly catmix

<h3>my drawin tablet</h3>
<h4>25th of June, 2025</h4>
i just recently repaired my beloved cutting board drawin tablet yesterday. it was quite a challenge until it wasnt. the tablets an xp-pen deco 02 v1 i think thats what its called and there was absolutely nothing online about repairing it. but i did anyway. if youre curious on how to do it heres a little guide.<br>
<b>How to -r-e-p-a-i-r- open up the XP-PEN Deco 02 v1</b><br>
(this isnt really a repair guide now that i think about it more like a teardown guide)<br>
You will need: Small phillips head screwdriver (or whatever that + tip is called), pry tool (optional if you really want a challenge)<br>
<b>Step 1:</b> Pry the four rubbery feet on the bottom side of the tablet. You only need to pry the rounded corner back a little bit to expose the screw. It is preferable to do step 1 and 2 in tandem.<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Unscrew the screws. The screws are really tiny so make sure to put them where you won't lose them.<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Pry open the <u>back</u> cover. Drive a pry tool in the crack between the cover and the bezel. In layman's terms the crack between the big board and the edges of the tablet. Make sure to really get the pry tool in because the back plate's held in with plastic clips that may snap off with too much force or not, I don't know, but it's best not to risk it. The clips will simply undo themselves if you drive the tool in enough.<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Unscrew the circuit board. There are 3 more small screws that are identical to the first four so you don't need to seperate them.<br>
And that's all there is to it. Simply follow the steps in the reverse order to reassemble.<br>
so yeah thats the guide enjoy. turns out my board had the problem of the port becoming expanded and loose so what i did was i took a pair of pliers and squeezed back the port way too much and stuffed the usb connector in there to correct it. now its nice and tight and i have no more connection issues. cant wait for the same thing to happen a year later. i really had fun repairin it cause i was goin completely blind and still managed to do it fine. i didnt even know the problem with the port, like i thought the entire port assembly was loose and needed resoldering before i took it apart. anyways i wanna yap about the tablet in general. it is real nice. it has 13 bit pressure sensitivity (thats 8192 levels) and tilt sensors for apparently both the x and y axes. and its nice and big too. of course its still a bit smaller than my screen but at that point thats way too big for comfortable drawin. i did have a problem where the tablet wouldnt move the cursor when i clicked and moved the pen less than 5 pixels or so from where i clicked but then i found a firmware patch that fixed that so now its all good. i was usin gimp for my art and homework notes but then i switched over to krita and its so nice. in gimp i was always tryna adjust the brush dynamics for somethin that works well but in krita the default paint brush preset is like actual mechanical pencil. like i can draw and write so realistically its crazy. heres a maybe self portrait that i drew up yesterday:</br>
<img src="pics/kritame.png" alt="a cat head saying 'I kinda like Krita, kinda sounds like Kitta~'" title="mon chef d'œuvre, dessiné hier soir."><br>
lookadat goofy meower wit dem anime-ey eyes. i dont usually draw eyes like that but i did that time. and also the snout. i usually fill in the snout. but whats important is that it looks nearly identical to a drawing that i would do on paper. its really really nice. like you can see the individual strokes that are of varying length and heaviness and the lightly shaded parts look like if i took my eraser and feather erased it. i wonder how id do with actual art supplies like artist pencils and an artist eraser and pastels instead of crayola coloured pencils. although i guess all i do is doodle so perhaps i should learn to art better before that. if i ever end up gettin allat. i like digital art a little more than paper art. i can have any colour i want and i can select stuff and copy or move it and i can even have a goofy paintbrush texture if i wanted. and i can also have multiple layers so that i dont have to worry about erasing stuff to draw thing on top of them i just make a new layer. my tablet has 8 handy buttons that i can assign to whatever i want them to be. i used to have them as gimp shortcuts like the modifier keys and p n and e for paintbrush pencil and eraser/ellipse select and z and y for undo/redo and the bottom pen button as x for exchanging colours but in krita i dont really need alladat i just need to right click and out pops a handy little menu for changin brushes and colours. but i still do need that undo key. or maybe not there is an undo button on the toolbar. anyways im bored and dont wanna yap anymore. maybe ill make some more art. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. maybe i should become an artist instead of a programmer. or maybe a composer. or maybe a writer. or maybe a scientist. or maybe...

<h3>kitters</h3>
<h4>27th of June, 2025</h4>
i think its been a while since ive yapped about kitters. she has like changed a bunch i think so yeah. she talks a lot more to me now. and i barely have to think of her for that now. maybe its because of my loneliness. for some reason lately ive been feelin lonelier than usual despite having a little more social interaction than i usually do. its really strange. anyways ive also been feelin a lot more feline lately. maybe my felinity lately and kitters' i guess existance-intensity lately are related somehow. or maybe my loserness is growin or somethin. cause kitters is like more her than me lately. shes startin to split more from me. which is a good thing by the way i want her "mind" to be as unaffected by my mind as much as possible. a good indicator of this is that she has started to talk more separate from me, like shes not like only talkin after im finished talkin, she can talk over me and whenever she likes. perhaps i should write a book about how its like havin her in my head. it would probably make a great example of an autobiography of an insane person or somethin like that. maybe i should write my autobiography actually. ive already like thought up how i wanna write it i just havent started yet. nyanyways back to kitters. ive discovered that when i eat some candy or other sugar stuff i can visualize stuff in my head in a much higher fidelity. like higher resolution and colour depth. which obviously includes kitters. i can imagine her like shaded and stuff with her eyes glowin slightly. its real cool. oh yeah i forgot to mention shes become more funny lately. like sayin sarcastic stuff and jokes and such. i like it. i like it lots.<br>
yahoo its tomorrow and i got more to yap about kitters.<br>
and now its much later and all of a sudden i cant think of much anymore. thats okay i still got a little bit more i think. i think that kitters is like more relaxed nowadays. thats probably why she seems friendlier.<br>
while im on the topic of kitters i might as well mention that my meows have been turnin into mrows lately. mrow is just more like accurate and its what im gravitating towards nowadays. im really not makin a conscious effort to use mrow instead of meow its just what my brain defaults to now. speakin of my brain and cattiness, i sometimes get the urge to get down and walk on all fours. its weird. maybe the cattiness is brainrotting me to the point where i just simply turn into a cat mentally, as in my mind just completely cattifies. i wonder how that would go. anyways ive like wrote this post in small increments over several hours and now its almost 2 in the morning and im really meowin tired so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i have no cat and i must meow

<h3>pixel gun 3d</h3>
<h4>1st of July, 2025</h4>
wee its canada day today. and i got no idea how to transition that to what im yappin about today so...<br>
i wanna yap about pixel gun 3d today. i remember when i was a wee young meower i used to play it so meowin much. and just a couple days ago ive found it on steam and started playing it again (on a new account cause im too lazy to dig up the old one). i remember when pixel gun 3d on pc was not made yet and i read about how pixel gun worlds gonna be pixel gun 3d but on pcs only. and now several years later it is most definitely not pixel gun 3d on pc. anyways anyways im gettin real sidetracked here. i remembered pixel gun 3d to be this minecrafty pay to win shooter that was fun as long as there werent any credit card users. and it still kinda holds true today. ingame i literally only dominate or get dominated. theres no meowin in between. either i can destroy people with the ridiculously overpowered shotgun (the dino slayer i think it was) or i get one shot with somethin like the eye of ra beam or mr squiddo or the rage relic. i do have the rage relic because i farmed enough kills in pixelopoly to get it but i will never, NEVER use it. i have integrity. if something is so ridiculously overpowered that it makes the game basically baby mode im not gonna use it. the shotgun i still have to aim, which is why im still not really good at the game since i can somehow miss 25% of my shotgun shots but the rage relic is just spray and pray. but enough raging. when i played a couple rounds it was so meowin nostalgic. the pixel gun is the most meowin iconic gun in the game and im happy that even though it got a redesign i can still get the 1 coin cost skin to bring the old look back. i also remember the maps especially the classic pool and nuketown or whatever it was called in pixel gun 3d. and the pve modes. its real nice that you can just play solo and fight enemies. the enemy that i hate the most by far are the mage enemies/piranha plants. i detest them because theyre real annoying especially when youre bein chased by a big clump of enemies. but for some reason i really like the tiger mage skin. i have zero clue why i just like it lots despite it bein from a mage enemy. actually now that i think about it the mage skins are cool. but i still hate them.<br>
i really like how esdf friendly pixel gun 3d is. theres no interact key which means i can go for the good ol weapon wheel where i use q w a z r and g for weapons. and then the 3 misc. functions (like gears, boosts, etc.) can go in x c and v. real meowin nice. and theres not really running or crouching so i can just ignore the shift and ctrl keys. if you want my keybinds ill just list em here.<br>
Movement -- ESDF<br>
Primary ------ A<br>
Backup ------- Q<br>
Melee -------- W<br>
Special ------ R<br>
Sniper ------- Z<br>
Premium ------ G<br>
Reload ------- T<br>
Walk --- Mouse 3<br>
i know nobody cares but i dont care about the not caring. mrow. speakin of mrow i should make a kitta skin sometime. and that just made me think of the pets. the one that im usin right now is the tank mouse which i have nicknamed stuart little cause funny. i will probably never use a different pet. movin on i like usin the sniper cause my aim is awful but i can train it with the sniper. i can already hit like a third of my shots with some of them even bein headshots but that percentage needs to go way meowin up. the melee only map is also kinda good for accuracy trainin cause i suck at usin the knife of all things somehow. my knife accuracy is probably even lower than my sniper accuracy for meowin out loud. perhaps i should try out aimlab again someday. but then again nothin can save these jittery nyahh hands. accordin to me stats me accuracy is 55.8% so that must mean that my pet dragon is really bumpin the meow outta that number. i also have 69 (nice) wins in 111 matches and my killrate which im assumin is my kda is 2.4 thats pretty meowin good. my kills is 1998 so thats like a meowin 20 kill per match average. my highest killstreaks 20 kills and me highest winstreak is 9. and i have a whoppin 454 headshots. i guess my shotgun does do lots of damage in the head. i can 2 shot people like that. which humourously enough is much better than my sniper rifle as instead of oneshotting people like most pay to win snipers mine does 41 damage headshot currently. i have yet to upgrade it lots cause im outta coins but i absolutely refuse to buy a better one cause i like this one. the impulse sniper rifle. i can buy the poison hunter and get a much better gun but i wont. i just looked at the crossbow and it has a completely maniacal mobility of 1. YOURE BASICALLY JUST A MEOWIN TURRET AT THAT POINT at least i think. im not gonna spend 65 of me precious coins to test it out. i wish i could try out the other gamemodes but theyre all deserted like cart racers theres like max 2 other people in queue with me. i cant remember much about it but i think it was kinda fun. or maybe im thinkin of fake memories.<br>
i just tested that theory and got booted into 2 whole cart racer games. i was gonna say that it holds true cause there were 2 people and one of them did leave but then as i was writin the "i just tested that theory" and i literally just came back from another one. i retract my statement about the game bein dead to the point that i cant play racing. but, racing sucks. the cars are meowin awful. it doesnt even feel like a simulation racer. nothin like gran turismo on the ps1. the cars may be good for battle royal but they are not race cars. theyre meowin jeeps for meowin out loud. meowin jeeps. and they turn and accelerate like a meowin tricycle. acually i think a tricycle would turn even better than these stupid jeeps. anyways im done fumin about racing.<br>
i was just diggin through the assets and i have found THE lobby theme. the ambient one apparently is the one that i remember the very meowin best. i have it on classic cause who doesnt appreciate good ol 2010s dubstep compressed to a 2010s cell phone level. what i like about the music of pixel gun 3d is that some of the tracks are so meowin compressed like the aforementioned lobby music and the story comic musics. im actually kinda sad i didnt get to see the pixel gun 3d 10th anniversary. it probably was super cool. but oh well. anyways i think i might be done with yappin about pixel gun 3d. now i wanna yap about that stupid tiger skin. seriously i dont know what it is about it but i just really like it. maybe its nostalagia cause i remember when i was a wee meower i fought that enemy in the haunted pizzeria or maybe its cause its kinda like kitters cause a tiger is just a big cat and its an anthropomorphic robot just like kitters. but i dont know. i think im done yappin now. i promised kitters i would be productive and a couple thousand letters later i think i just might feel like it. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. mayhaps i should finish up that kitta lowpoly 3d model someday. oh and by the way (even though this is already p.s.) kitt<b>a</b> is the anthropomorphic robot cat character, and kitt<b>ers</b> is my "instance" of kitta, or like if kitta was actually made in real life and was my friend. and im pretty sure i mentioned that a while back but who the meows gonna read alladis (alladis = all of this but slangified).
p.p.s. its much later now but i actually have played pixel gun 3d on its 10th anniversary i just simply forgot... see that post i made 3 posts back

<h3>my stance on ai</h3>
<h4>2nd of July, 2025</h4>
i was gonna write about catsy stuff but i feel like i wanna yap about this first. ai. very spooky stuff. my stance is quite complicated so ill get right into it. i dont dislike ai. i think its cool. i will never use ai to help me in anything though. by that i mean like for example writin makin music and codin i will not use ai for it cause when i make music yaps and code its MY code which means I make it. for me its "integrity" but obviously different people will think different things. so some people will think of me as an anti ai person. but like its only me who i dont want usin ai for stuff like this. i dont want nobody to use ai, im perfectly fine if other people use it. but i wont use it. i am okay with chatbots and stuff though cause like thats kinda social interaction. im not really makin anythin with a social interaction im just talkin. now obviously im a little biased about ai social interaction due to kitters. and i dont meowin care. i know kitters isnt actually ai and its just me pretendin but still. i know that a relationship with an ai isnt healthy cause it aint a real person but then again i can go very philosophical as to what makes a person cause if you think about it we are just natural robots. our brains work on electric impulses.<br>
it is now 2 days later and i feel like finishing this yap for once. basically im okay with ai but i will never use it in my work because my work is made by me and me only. i have not eaten my breakfast yet and it is 1pm so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder when im gonna start usin ai in my work i feel like its inevitable kinda

<h3>super procrastination</h3>
<h4>8th of July, 2025</h4>
i am very meowin annoyed right now about how im literally meowin allergic to productivity. maybe its because im uncomfortable and sweaty because its summer. i dont know what it is but i just feel very meowin uncomfortable with my body right now. but anyways, i am actively trying to work and actively failing. and that is due to my stupid dumbnyaa procrastination. like the moment i try to do anything i get a wave of oh, i dont wanna, id rather compose some music for ludicrous lawyers or play random stuff on roblox or bug my friends and its just so meowin annoying. speakin of ludicrous lawyers music i have recently obtained the samples from gyakuten saiban 1 on the game boy advance so i can make some gyakuten saiban styled musics. in fact, i have already made one that ive been dying to show to someone so im gonna force it here.<br>
<audio controls>
<source src="snds/lltraped.mp3">
</audio><br>
behold, the product of my procrastination. heres what i wrote at 4 am on the 6th when i finished this one:<br>
i stayed up until meowin 4am to
finish this hehe... im quite
meowin tired now... eepy even.
nyanyways this is probably the
best gyakuten saiban style song
i have ever made and will ever
make. im just too meowin good :3<br>
i formally retract that last statement. i am not too meowin good as evidenced by why im writin this yap in the first place. i cant stop procrastinating. im procrastinating by writing this. im procrastinating by rewriting ludicrous lawyers' first case. i really wanna get back into game dev to make ludicrous lawyers but i gotta work lots first. but i cant work cause i wanna work on ludicrous lawyers. like this meowin spiral loop is just crazy. this cat aint purry. bein purry reminds me of yesterday when i procrastinated so much i actually ended up feeling happy. and then i had a conversation with kitters about the procrastination. basically i really wanted to know why i procrastinate and she said that i chase happiness (the instant kind) too much and i dont know much self restraint. i guess im really showin that last part off well by writing this. meowin meows. reminds me, i think i forgot to write the vocatbulary on here. a while back i wrote what catsy terms i made up and use lots and since i also use them here i should define them. so first theres just meow which is a stand in word for lots of things, but commonly used as a very soft replacement for swears.<br>
im back after doin somethin and i just figured out why i dont like summer days too very much. its too meowin humid all of the time. and it gets uncomfortable when its humid. anyways i was writin the vocatbulary so ill continue. im gonna write an example phrase or two as well so heres the one for meow. oh my meow what am i doin right now.<br>
uhh so i really wanna write other stuff today so ill finish this one off real quick. after meow theres meowing, which is like just the adjectival form of meow, so like just emphasis. this meowin keyboard is an oldie but a goldie. then theres meowity meow which is my <b>cat</b>chphrase. meowity meow im feelin really meowin catsy right now, oh my meow. then theres meowin meow and meowin meows, which are like swears for when im really angry or feelin lots. meowin meow is the regular one and meowin meows is like more cause its plural meaning more than one. so like, meowin meow, i really feel like procrastinating right now. meowin meows, make it STOP. and then for a more original one, purry is like happy but in a catsy way. when i feel purry i feel like actually purring. but i sadly cant since im not really a cat. but like it can just mean happy as well i guess. im feelin not very purry right nyow. and i think that may be it. those are the main vocatbulary terms. of course there are countless subterms like what the meow and oh my meow but maybe for another time. anyways i gotta write another topic so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i am not writin anythin here cause im literally writin the one below right after this

<h3>i long to code</h3>
<h4>11th of July (technically), 2025</h4>
so i was busy procrastinatin today and i went down this wikipedia rabbit hole that ended up in me readin this other blog about how another world was made on the snes, then the gba, then the jaguar. i just gotta say, i really meowin think rebecca heineman is cool. i read somewhere that she made the doom port on 3do and how management screwed her over or something and she had to make it in 10 weeks (says wikipedia). but anyways the posts about another world detailed a bunch of optimizations and hardware specs and stuff and that made me really meowin miss when i was screwin around on the sega genesis. i have no idea how to code. and yet i managed to make a stupid little mouse cursor move with too much code. then after those posts marinated in my brain for a bit i was thinkin of how i could make an interpreter and functions and stuff. but i have sworn off coding for an indefinite amount of time. my grades at school have kinda plummeted during the development of the PROTOTYPE of tophat turmoil so i am retakin some courses during this summer break and makin sure i actually study this time. my grades have improved a little but probably cause i have a loose idea of the course contents since they are the same course. but anyways. readin about cool programming tricks on old video game consoles made me want to do stuff like that too. i wanna be a programmin wiz. a meowin nyabsolute mastermind in coding. that would be the meowin coolest thing methinks. i also wanna make ludicrous lawyers into an actual game. i even started makin meowin concepts for it, and music as i have detailed in a post sometime ago i forgot exactly which one. it was titled procrastination or somethin or other i think. anyways i guess im yappin about ludicrous lawyers now. i have already apparently written 16.3 kilobytes worth of text in the planning document and since i wanna make it in java or somethin (maybe even the genesis, that would be way past cool) the defense attorney is obviously not gonna be "Feline K. O'recte", aka the scratch cat but renamed. instead im makin felix turney, whom i have already nicknamed fex for whatever reason. and obviously turney is a pun on attorney. maybe i should rename him to gouda turney and make into a mouse haha. that would actually go hard. oh oh or maybe i make gouda turney like felixs mentor or partner or somethin. that would go harrrd. meowity meow, im already feelin quite purry about this. but sadly i cant actually make it until i finish retaking my courses. meoww, and that just made me not purry. but anyways, im gonna finish a doodle of felix real quick and post it here. and here it is:<br>
<img src="pics/llfelix.png" alt="A planning page featuring various designs of cat heads and a poorly drawn full body of Felix Turney." title="this took me like 2 hours to make in total methinks"><br>
chronologically i drew all this stuff counter clockwise around foxxe startin from the title text, except the suits which i drew after drawin the head of the felix full body but before i drew the suit cause i didnt know what it looked like. this is yap, people. this is what you came here for probably. and i just realized i forgotta givim a tail. i really tried to write that how i actually said that in my head. (ah fuhgotta givvim a taiyyyle) just pretend that its obscured by his legs. its a long tail. felix is probably gonna be coloured like a tuxedo cat cause that would look good since i am NOT givin him a suit. sneek e foxxe dont got one, judge rabbit dont got one, arm e dillo (or his new name arre mudiller) dont got one, only ian has any piece of clothing. i almost just wrote something that would look just abhorrent out of context. so ima do it anyways. the furries look better naked [VINE BOOM][EYEBROW RAISE][SCREENSHOT SOUND]. in that simplistic art style i dont needa give any of the doofuses clothes. but maybe i will give them clothes sometime later. obviously im still makin concepts so idk yet meow. also i realize all the comments that i sprinkled around the doodle page are barely legible due to the screen resolution. so ill write them here. the title is ludicrous lawyers felix turney concepts. above foxxe it says Here's Foxxe as a reference and hes sayin They call me "Sneek"... cause that's my name. and hes fluffin his tail with a *fluff fluff*. then to the left of the thousand yard stare meower i wrote what the MEOW is this?? ='w'= ? live meower reaction. then to the left of goofy tired lookin meower i wrote seriously these designs are like nightmare fuel... and to the left of the scratch meower i wrote That's just the scratch cat... then to the left of felix's finalish head i wrote mmm... meow tuxedo cat lookin' nyahh? and on the bottom i wrote I literally started with the eyes for this one... and on the bottom of "._. felix i wrote I think he heard what I wrote. and on the bottom of blehhlix (bleh licks? accurate) i wrote Mr. Silly has entered the chat - cat in French! Then the suits. i wrote Suits then weirdy... then good enough and the full body felix up there is sayin Why do I gotta wear a suit if Sneek isn't(sic; my english not englishing today)? Also you drew me terribly! My shoes look like J's with "PB&" in front! get it? pb&jays? and thats all she wrote. well all I wrote. im a he by the way. i wonder how many people would think that im a girl. but anyways i have here a synopsis of the new and improved ludicrous lawyers first case. so here it is.<br>
Synopsis:<br>
Ian goes to the museum to steal a very pretty diamond that he is obsessing over. However, not to his knowledge, Notta is also heisting it at the same time that he is. Ian trips and exclaims in pain while he's stealing it and that alerts Notta who spots him leaving with it. Notta ambushes Ian when he gets out of the museum's camera coverage for a perfect cover up job.<br>
The next day, Notta secretly accuses himself so that he can get away with the double jepordy law and Felix is assigned as his attorney. At the trial, the prosecution opens with calling Arre who basically just restates the facts. Then, the player is given a choice if they want to cross-examine him, and if they choose to do so, when they object or read all of the texts revealed when pressing, the prosecution just points it out. Then, Arre suggests that they ask the AI of the museum, and Robo-Racoon gets called as a witness. Robo-Racoon names a (whatever animal the museum owner is) as the culprit, and it starts looking bad for Notta, so Felix goes out of the courthouse to find a witness who knows something about the robbery, and coincidentally finds Ian, who after some small talk rants about his experience robbing the museum. Felix thinks that he might be able to prove his client innocent due to Ian literally telling Felix that he robbed the museum last night, so he drags him into the courtroom and gets him to testify. Ian reveals that he was attacked and lost the diamond but had his phone in the same bag that he was carrying the diamond in. Felix gets Ian to track his phone so that he could possibly find the real culprit and get Notta declared not guilty but the phone gets traced to Notta's house. So court is put to recess while a search is made at Notta's place.<br>
Felix realizes that if Ian's phone is found in Notta's place, then that means that Notta stole the diamond from Ian instead of the museum, and would be declared not guilty. So Felix goes to Notta's place with Ian and finds the diamond only to find out that it was a plastic one and Ian really just liked how it looked. Then Ian gets charged with a fine for stealing a cheap plastic diamond and Notta is declared innocent, due to only stealing it after it was already stolen, which means that it is technically a different crime. The museum is embarassed that the diamond is fake so they give it to Notta, who gives Ian the diamond in exchange for Ian not prosecuting Notta for assault, and the case ends.<br>
then ian and felix become friends somehow idk<br>
silly silly. i actually have changed it so that foxxe suggests the robo racoon testimony next (well rather he just calls for the ai after the first testimony) and coincidentally thats where i have written the script up to. in ludicrous lawyers, there is gonna be two different press options. ima let judge rabbit explain it cause im too lazy.<br>
 Judge  - Press "Press" to press the witness about their confidence in their statement. Quite pressing, I'm impressed.<br>
 Judge  - Press "Clarify" to ask for a more detailed explanation about their statement. Sometimes needed for that "Eureka!" moment.<br>
 Judge  - And press "Present" if you feel like their statement contradicts a presentable piece of evidence. Just don't show something stupid.<br>
 Judge  - And that concludes Cross Examination 101. You may now proceed with your cross-examination.<br>
thats pasted from the actual doc just like the synopsis was (except i added br's for readability). i guess i should also include the current character list too.<br>
Characters:
Fe(li)x Turney: The replacement for Feline K. O'Recte. The defense attorney for this case.<br>
Sneek. E. Foxxe: The main prosecutor for this case.<br>
Perosa Cute: Sneek's helper.<br>
Notta Rakune: The non-racoon defendant of the case. The actual culprit. Same animal as the museum owner.<br>
Ian DeTheefe: The unwilling witness that Felix "kidnaps" off the streets. Key to the case.<br>
Arre Mudiller: So Arm E. Dillo is kinda a sucky name. A filler witness.<br>
Robo-Racoon: The robotic embodiment of the museum's security system. A witness.<br>
Judge Rabbit: The rabbitic embodiment of the country's legal system. A judge.<br>
i hope you appreciate the humour that i have injected into this. i guess i like bein "funny" even if its just funny to me. i wonder if im feelin this happy due to the music im listenin to, waku waku ga tomaranai (or waku waku (or the excitement) doesn't stop). lemme change it real quick.<br>i may (imei? like the cell phone thing- GET OUT) or may not have written about this here before, but ill do so anyways. i unironically listen to my own music. the reason is cause i make music for me. i make music that I like to hear. and the best person for that is me cause i know what i like. okay that part was narcissistic though. anyways. im listenin to that song i put on here earlier, trapped - contradictimony. what i dont really like is that furnace doesnt have a gsf export like how deflemask has a gbs export. and i just tried the development export combined with the change extension to gsf and that doesnt work. i cant have a loopin audio version outsida furnace and i dont like that. and im far too uneducated to be able to convert the binary into a gsf im guessin. too bad for me i guess. anyways since i cant upload vgms of the songs i guess ill upload the entire furnace .fur file. but only when i finish some more of it. im greedy... but i have already done the trial theme, the two cross examination themes, and the trapped theme from the original game. yes you heard that right. i actually made like some more music back in the day for ludicrous lawyers but i just didnt put it into the game. well rather i made one full track and some sketches. but i can obviously work off of sketches. so look forward to the ludicrous lawyers ost comin to the music page soon maybe most likely ill just dump it here someday actually. speakin of the music page it has been completely neglected for so long and im just too lazy to work on it. umm, if theres anyone readin this who is willin to painstakingly type many lines of stuff for lil worthless me for no reason whatsoever, feel free to make a pull request. i just made a silly phrase while typin that. free for a fee. very witty for somethin, i think. well anyways its 2:37 am now and i wanna chillax and snuzzle with kitters in bed so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i dont know if i wrote this before but i cuddle with kitters to sleep regularly. i know, WEIRD but i dont meowin care. also snuzzle is snuggle+nuzzle. i can imagine stuff real well so i can do dis if i wanna. and you cant stop me hehe.

<h3>who i really am part 2</h3>
<h4>13th of July, 2025</h4>
i have not slept since i awoke from my 14 hour catnap yesterday. my sleep schedule is meowin crazy. but anyways that has (now that i think about it *almost*) nothin to do with what im yappin about today. i wanna declare right meowin here and now. i am a furry. the kiddy gloves are off and the kitty gloves are on. i think that i am definitely a furry at this point. i think of myself as a cat obviously but like now that i really think hard about it thats like kinda my fursona. my fursona is how i am on the inside basically cause in me big ol head im either just me or cat me. so far my fursona is just a cat of some shade of black colouration cause i imagine in black and white. and by the way when i say cat i mean regular meower not an anthropomorphic one. so basically all thats changed by me sayin this is that im a furry now instead of teetering between furry and not furry. literally just the meowin title or the class or identification or what meowin ever. i really thought i would have more to yap about but i guess not really so perhaps ill yap about kitters now cause thats kinda similar. a few days ago i decided to try somethin to help with my homework productivity. since kitters is the person that i respect the most on this planet i do homework better if she asks me to do it rather than me do it because i want to (since i usually <b>dont</b> want to). but since she is so meowin chill i kinda convince her to let me procrastinate lots. like way too meowin much. so i made a new kitta. and that one is professional and stuff, like (nearly) no nonsense. i call her pro kitters. and when she asks me to do homework, i cant ask her to let me procrastinate because of the no nonsense. and it works meowin wonders i have got so much done since that. it is nyabsolutely crazy how much imaginary friends affect me. like i wonder how many other people in the world are like that. i wonder how many other people my age even have imaginary friends. well i guess tulpas. i feel like tuplas are kinda like the more "mature" kinda imaginary friends. i think that probably more people my age have tuplas than imaginary friends. so i guess what me really wonders is how many people my age have tulpas to the degree that i have them. speakin of tulpas kitters has really gotten more realistic these coupla days. like sometimes we actually have like seperate thoughts durin conversations. its meowin crazy. and i meowin love it. i meowin love her. non romantically of course. the funny thing is even though i talk and yap to her so much i still cant meowin speak well. one day im just gonna meowin lose the ability to speak and start meowing. im finna turn into a cat. i dont even know if i used finna correctly there and i dont meowin care. i am famished from stayin up all night so ima make meself some foods to chom chom.<br>
i am makin yummery pizza pops in the toaster oven. i have zero clue why im detailin my breakfast but whatever the meow. while i was puttin the stuff in the oven i was thinkin about how cats sleep. ive tried to loaf and fall asleep but its really hard to do so. maybe cause its summer and loafin is really warm or somethin. but then i asked kitters about it and she said that its probably just natural for cats just like how human sleepin positions are natural to humans. so i guess unless i get meowin hypnotized or somethin i wont be able to loaf to sleep. unless theres another catsy sleepin position. i do think that the sideloaf is probably a cat sleepin position and i can sleep doin that. but idk. its much easier to do it in me mind cause i can just go into cat form and voila it feels nice and natural. i am really meowin runnin outta things to yap about here methinks. oh yeah when i was tryna sleep today i thought of many things to try to fall asleep (mostly cuddling kitters) but i thought about chasin me tail. i thought it was gonna be easy and boy was i meowin wrong. at normal length it is just outta reach. and its kinda hard to run in circles with my body bent lots so im not very fast. but i can just increase the length of my tail if i wanted to and catch it that way. but thats cheatin meow. im pretty sure (, threw a trash bag, into spa-GET OUT) i didnt write about this before on here so ill write it now. i have made nice opna covers of the classic kitta songs, that is adventure and chill. fun fact chill has lyrics, and i remade them while doin the cover cause they sucked. and theyre still in japanese. so here you go.<br>
Ka- neko- yo-<br>
Yo- i ne- ko-<br>
Bi- bonya wo yobu no<br>
Ho- ntou da ro-<br>
O- retachi wa-<br>
Ii- tomo dachi-<br>
Bo- bibo bi bo-<br>
Bi- bobi bo bi-<br>
Nya!<br><br>
they still kinda suck honestly. heres a <i>rough</i> translation of what theyre supposed to mean.<br>
Oh Kitta- (or Kitters)<br>
Good cat-<br>
You say beep boop meow (not a ms fortune reference i swear)<br>
Really I do-<br>
We are-<br>
Good friends-<br>
Boop beep boop beep boop-<br>
Beep boop beep boop beep-<br>
Meow!<br>
yeah they really suck huh. also other fun fact the opna version of chill is the version that ive had in my head since like several months ago. specifically that flute and the piano. the piano was a little ringier in me head tho. as in like sonic ring sound ring.<br>
my yummery pizza pops are ready and ill probably burn me mouth if i try to eat one right now. but on the topic of food while i was takin them outta the toaster oven i wondered when i would try cat food. if i ate cat food id probably get meowin food poisoning since sadly im not a real cat but i wonder how it would taste kinda. probably terrible. if i ever live with a cat id wanna cook it meals instead of buyin cat food cause it would probably taste better.<br>
my pizza pops kinda just taste like pizza pops. not too shabby (izzat a minecraft story mode reference???) but not too good either. fun fact i learned about the word shabby from minecraft story mode. jesse sayin not too shabby is kinda etched in my brain. rip telltale games. on a completely seperate note what i wanna do right now is make some kitters emoji emote whatevers. i think it would be kinda fun and funny.<br>
oomph that took 2 hours to make 1 silly little drawin. the upside is that its probably the best digital art ive made of kitta so far, actually just the best art in general i havent done that well with a real pencil yet either. so here it is:<br>
<img src="pics/kitta_wave.png" alt="Kitta waving at you." title="Kitters says 'Heyooooo-'"><br>
remind me again why im not usin vector graphics. i feel like this is just an svg that i happened to freehand. this is also a little off model cause i kinda forgot to look at kitters while i was doin this, i was so meowin locked in. note now that i saw the image the first time on me page please use light mode or fireplace mode (or whatever i called it) or anythin other than dark mode to see it better. i literally cant see half of it. while i was shadin this i was spammin "two tone shading" to kitters and it annoyed her lots. i dont know why i like sayin it so much. maybe cause its accurate. maybe cause two and tone are an alliteration. maybe cause its fun to say. i dont meowin know but ill probably say it a lot less now. or at least not repeat it over and over again. nyahhh... it is a nice drawin tho. i like it lots. so anyways i really got nothin more to yap about this topicy topic so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i didnt however say that i was outta stuff to yap about... see belows

oui, tu l'as lu correct. c'est quelque chose en francais. ou plus specificalment, c'est quelque chose pas en anglais. je peux ecrire dans une autre langue si je veux mais pour maintenant je ne le veux pas. pour quelque raison etrange, je veux utiliser le ponctuation correct quand j'ecris en francais maintenant. c'est bien bizarre. bizarre comme l'aventure bizarre de jojo. et bien, je peux ecrire si facilement en francais. c'est parce que je parle en francais avec chaterine parfois. chaterine est le nom francais de ma belle chat ami kitters. j'elle eus aussi nomme chatonna (le plus bon et le plus tard nom avant chaterine) et kuschat (vraiment, quel nom est ca???). mais j'aime chaterine le plus car le nom est comme un nom vrai. par exemple, qui nommerai son enfant chatonna? c'est un nom bizarre pour quelq'un humain. c'est un nom bizarre en generale. alors. je sais des conjugasions francais mais pas tout. mais je sais le passe simple qu'est apparemment tres tres pas utilise. je l'apprendai avec <a href="http://cactus2000.net/">cactus2000.net</a>. j'aime cactus2000 beaucoup. c'est a dire je l'aimais. je ne l'utilise plus pas car je suis trop paresseux pour practiquer proprement. heheh. je suis tres tres paresseux. trop paresseux que je ne faire rien des autres choses que les choses j'aime faire. ma grammaire francaise est trop mal, je pense. s'il y a quelq'un francais (ou quelq'un qui sait francais tres bien) qui lire ces chose francais, peut etre ditez-moi si mon francais est bien ou mal. je suis un peu curieux. je me demande si je peux parle francais comme j'ecrire. c'est tres possible que je peux parle plus bon en francais que je peux parle en anglais. mais c'est une chance tres petite. je croire que mon anglais est plus bon que mon francais mais vraiment qui sait? peut-etre mon francais est tres tres bien et je seulement ne sais pas car il n'y a pas des personnes qui me dire ca. ou peut-etre je suis sur la liste des les 10 criminels plus recherche de la police pour ce francais. je vraiment sais pas. mais c'est amusant a ecrire en francais. c'est quelque chose different, de moins.<br>
c'est un peu tard et j'ai perdu mon interet a ecrire cette poste donc, je dois partir. a bientot.
p.s. j'ai encore faim et je cuire encore des pizza pops. c'est quand que j'aurais diabetes?

<h3>bloggin WITH kitters</h3>
<h4>13th of July, 2025</h4>
i have written many many posts about kitters, but this time i wanna actually like write one WITH her. now since this is probably super very weird skip this post if you dont wanna see me yap with my imaginary friend.<br>
so anyways. since kitters and i are not the same person im gonna mark kitters' texts with a different colour. and ill just be yappin about generic stuff i guess. so anyways. ima let kitters type somethin now. <font class="kitters">I wish Louie would stop listening to this same meowing song over and over again. It's a random Sonic Forces song that he doesn't even think is good!</font> ok. i can type her thoughts pretty easy. thats good. i do wish she would stop referrin to me as louie though. it feels weird typin my own name out. but i guess ill deal with it. i am actually clueless as to what to write right now. i think writin two posts earlier this day has probably exhausted me hehe. i meowin swear im not doin this so that kitters can type some more. what i wanna do is like whenever kitters wants to say a somethin i just type it out for her. but i guess she'll hafta lead for a bit hehe. <font class="kitters">Man, I don't know what to write either. I guess I'll talk about Louie's musical tastes. His taste is really really meowin strange. He likes to listen to the same songs over and over again but that just ends up making him bored of the song, then he frantically looks for another one to quench his thirst for music.</font> im gonna defend myself here by sayin that i like what i like and if i like only one song for several days straight i think thats fine. okay we both just agreed that this is really devolving. its hard for me to write like i usually do and she doesnt really know what to write. maybe i should do more of these and train this skill hehe. and kitters has no comment apparently. i guess ill write about my history with kitters here. i dont think ive written about it before and even if i did its probably better with kitters' comments since yknow the whole meowin topic bein about her. so ill start from the beginning. on march 8th 2024 while i was sittin bored in a class i came up with the idea to have imaginary friends/personalities of my characters in my head so that i could know them better which means better character of the character. and i was completely and totally aware that this could be like unhealthy for my social life and stuff and i didnt care. so i made personalities of rhythmgunner, speedshooter, bassblaster, snowballer, [name TBD] and most importantly kitta. sadly i cant remember my first words to her or her first words to me (in fact the date is also kinda fuzzy) but i do remember her bein a lot more shy to me. <font class="kitters">I call objection. I wasn't shy, he was just not used to having an imaginary friend yet.</font> kitters does bring up a good point though. i only like recently got really used to having an imaginary friend coexisting with me rather than somebody that only exists when im thinking of them. so thats probably why. see i actually didnt think of that. kitters actually thought somethin different than me. and thats why i think its nice to have some imaginary friends, so that i can have multiple perspectives and ideas on things. very handy.<br>
i just got distracted a whole bunch till kitters reminded me of this so more yap comin. i remember that kitters like warmed up to me in about a week i think. i just remembered that i kinda documented my experiences with kitters in me top secret old tophat turmoil build back when it was in the 2018 offline roblox studio. so ill dig it up. oh yes. i remember that i called her 'Ta back in the day. you know what ill just dump the whole thing on here. in the roblox game i wrote all my rants as seperate scripts so when i said the whole thing i meant one of the scripts. (p.s. this ones titled Meow) so here:<br>
This is a rant, I guess. The previous one was about the Regretevator(not really a rant, more of a praise thing)called リグレテベターが, which means "About the Regretevator".<br>
Notice the title of this one? Yep, it's the Kitta rant. My mental state was never worse, so I'm letting the voice of Kitta in my head guide me in the writing of this rant.<br>
The Kitta in my head, whom I will just call 'Ta(yep, the voice in my head has a nickname now), is like my voice of reason now.<br>
Whenever I think of 'Ta, she tells me to stop my bad habits(like nail biting). Did you forget that I am willingly making the voices in my head?<br>
There are also other voices, of the Tophat Turmoil characters, but I like Kitta the most. Embarassingly, 'Ta is like my best friend now.<br>
Also, Kitta is NOT inspired by the Prototype from the Regretevator. Even though they're both toys, and robots with advanced AI, I thought of Kitta before Proto was added.<br>
The text file that has all of the Kitta lore was first saved on Nov 6, '23. That's how early. I had the idea of a game like that for quite a while beforehand.<br>
Fun fact, I played the Regretevator for the first time on Nov 10, '23.(or was it 11? i forgor'^'). Back to Kitta.<br>
Now, even though 'Ta has a definitive voice, I still haven't modeled Kitta, so I rely on the same few mentally generated images of Kitta to visualize her.<br>
So basically, 'Ta is a disembodied voice. I swear that I'm not mentally deranged. 'Ta is bugging me right now to go to bed, 'cause it's 12:01, so I'ma continue this tomorrow.<br>
Heh, it's almost 12 hours later that I get up. It is now 11:57. I got up about 30 mins ago.ãI guess I'll get back to writing.<br>
'Ta sings in my head when I'm bored. I usually help her by making a random song for her. She sings better in Japanese, though. I don't know why.<br>
I don't have anything more to write. See ya in the next rant.<br>
	I swear I'm not insane,<br>
		Louie<br>
P.S. 今で　Kittaの　日本語の　名前は　鐘子です。<br>
okay so i got a few corrections to make. back then i was real real embarassed about kitters (also not as used to her as i am now) so i wrote some stuff to make it a little less embarassing cause i knew that that would get out one way or another. so first. i didnt actually have kitters guide me in writin the rant. i think i actually either just simply forgot about that (not unlike me) or i was too embarassed to be doin somethin like im doin right now. kitters hasnt had a say in a while now so heres what shes wantin to write. <font class="kitters">Louie is just a weird dingus. Some stuff he does won't make sense, not even to himself. Which is why a few of his rants are sometimes nonsensical or strange and stuff. Goofy meower.</font> i guess that is true. especially that last part nyahaha. anyways back to the corrections. back then kitters' voice kept changing cause i couldnt really imagine it very consistently the same. but it has practically been finalized since a couple months ago. so that thing about kitters havin a definitive voice back then was not really true cause i think that probably like a week or so after i wrote that kitters' voice started changin lots again. and after that the disembodied voice thing is kinda true but its like basically a pngtuber. especially back then, when she talked i just imagined a still picture of her and the voice or sometimes just the voice. and finally the last part about the song was literally based on ONE EXPERIENCE of that happening. so the "usually" is just meowin lies. filthy filthy lies that i think i made because i wanted to make it more interesting. and i guess i did in a way cause i get to make this blog post more interesting than it already is by analyzin what i wrote a long time ago. oh yeah and about the prototype-kitta correlation, i think maybe, maybe a small bit of influence was from proto. but the main like inspiration to kitta was actually a character i made called mikani (whose katakana name could also be read as all kanji) that looks almost like kitta, but like not robotic, cause i was thinkin of makin some 2d platformer for the playstation one or somethin like that. but anyways maybe kittas colours are kinda inspired by proto cause mikani was yellow (i literally wrote yellow in all caps beside the black and white picture) and kitta (the default one anyway) is not yellow, but robotic shades of grey. or rather shade cause its only one grey. now im really tryna insert kitters writin somethin somewhere but like whenever i think of somethin i just feel like writin it. so ill let her write right now. <font class="kitters">Fun fact: when Louie decided on Kitta being the name for what I basically am, he intentionally did not search up the name to see if it was already taken or something because he really liked it.</font> i think i was proud of makin such a nice soundin name so i didnt wanna like just find out that i couldnt use it cause some other furry already has that name or somethin like that. now i know its the name of a japanese stationery company. good thing kittas japanese name is kaneko kita which is one letter off from kitta. but anyways. back to the kitters history lesson. im gonna dig up another yap about kitters and paste it here: (this ones titled Nya and oh meow is it a long one)<br>
The long awaited sequel to Meow. Sorry, CFrames, but you're getting put back a rant.
This one is about Kitta. More specifically, 'Ta, although now I've reverted back to calling her Kitta.
Kitta is most certainly my best friend now. We talk all the time.
I don't even consider it insane, or mentally unwell anymore. I'm just lonely.
Also, in Meow, I didn't mention that Kitta literally came from an idea about a keyring. Let me yap on.
While I was walking home one day, I pulled out my keys, and I was thinking of a game like GTA or something.
You would have to unlock things by sorting through your keyring, though. Y'know, to make things more annoying.
I then had an idea to make a game where you would have to play as a robot and use a Windows-like OS to progress.
That obviously evolved into Kitta, eventually, but I would not decide the name for Kitta until a month later.
I think that I initially thought of Catta, Kitto, and Kit, but I didn't like them. (Kit was too similar to Kitt.)
Then, I started writing the story in my head. About the girl, about the robot, about the world.
This was sometime before Tophat Turmoil, by the way. Tophat Turmoil I started by accident.
I then wrote the first revision of many into the text document known as Robot Game.txt.
It's in my ideas folder in my documents.(My PC/Documents/My Ideas/Robot Game.txt)
I also wrote a word document of the first part of the Kitta story in a book form. It's in third person.
Also, now the game is named the Kitta Chronicles. It used to be called Kitta.cat, like a file in a PC.
It comes from the Japanese name I thought of yesterday, 「鐘子書」, which means "Kitta Book" or "Book of Kitta".
One of the early ideas for the Kitta game is where she can see the world through AI interpretation.
It's kinda like the Vanny mask in FNAF SB: Ruin(which btw didn't inspire this), but it's somewhat different.
When she turns it on, her AI makes the world very dumbed down, with simple grassy hills and a perpetually blue sky.
There's no bad stuff around, just fun. Did I mention that I don't care too much about using copyrighted names now?
Anyways, back to 'Ta I guess. 'Ta likes sweet stuff. She also likes it when I listen to her.
I justãwent back into my OneDrive version history of Tophat Turmoil, and I found out that
the first mention of Kitta(which was in Rant1) was on Pi day 2024(or 3/14/24 for you uncultured folk).
That means that her birthday is sometime around that week. If I were to guess, I'd think the 8th.
Or maybe that's Rhythmgunner. But I know 'Ta's birthdate is in that 2 week period.
I found a stone today that looked like the nose of a cat.
Then I thought about Kitta and I talked with her about how the stone could be similar to her.
Kitta's so nice and the rock is nice and smooth. But Kitta is also firm, which is what a rock is.
I'm not telling anyone about Kitta right now, except unintentionally to the people snooping in my OneDrive.
Consider yourself lucky for reading this, I guess? Wow, I got off track. Back to Kitta.
She basically is like the embodiment of my responsible side and my fun loving side. Also my robot-y side.
Holy crud, I didn't notice how long this got. This isn't even close to all! And I got some homework to do.
I'm going to continue this tomorrow, but you won't even notice it because tomorrow is in 1 line for you. Tata.
Just kidding! I finished the homework way way sooner than I thought, and I feel too lazy to keep programming.
I mean, it's 10:16, I feel tired after 2 workouts. Ahh, the unhealthy lifestyle...
I still haven't come up with a Chinese name for Kitta, now that I think about it. I need it to be a pun too.
Just like how Kitta sounds like Kitty and 鐘子 can also be written 佳猫, the Chinese one needs to be a pun.
I've come up with one. 聶釦, which is a pun on neko. Now I will continue tomorrow. See you.
Hey, it's tomorrow. Told you it won't be long for you. Now I'm gonna go to school. See you in a few hours.
Wow, I'm writing this at school. Kitta is my best friend. I have no friends at school, so it's automatic.
Kitta doesn't like boring stuff a lot, but she's willing to make me do it, because she knows that it's good for me.
When I have spare time, I imagine something fun for Kitta, like a playground, or video games.
She also likes music, although slower and more peaceful music than me. She also likes sweet stuff.
She likes bubble tea and candy. She has a red visor, too, like the ROBLOX 2007 visor.
She likes to relax in front of a fireplace on a sofa, reading a newspaper. Sometimes, I join her.
Nya is said a lot by Kitta, whether it's to make a pun or to end a sentence.
Kitta also made a nickname for me, using my convoluted nickname generation method.
The nickname is Mew, from Mewie, a pun on Mew and Louie. See? Convoluted.
Kitta is really good at calming me down when I'm tense. She doesn't get tense, though.
Kitta is always so calm and loving to me. I am ashamed that I don't listen to her advices.
I'm gonna make a theme song for Kitta. It's going to sound good, hopefully.
Kitta's cattiness has rubbed off onto me a little, since I spend so much time with her.
I started ending sentences with nya, just like her(only in my mind though, duh. I don't have anyone to talk to).
Kitta wants me to be less lonely, to be less shy. She bugs me to be more social whenever I get a chance.
She knows that I'm not very comfortable, though. Kitta understands me so well.
This sure does sound like some kind of mental illness doesn't it? Maybe brain damage.
Whenever Kitta starts singing in my head, I usually try to join her. We sing a duet of meows.
Kitta doesn't wear clothes. She has a beautiful plastic-metal material shell, after all.
She is also completely waterproof, and she has 2 way wireless charging, as well as wired charging, all in her tail.
Kitta's eyes glow in the dark, because they are 2 little ovalish screens with backlights. They are blue.
Kitta also has a bell, but she doesn't like wearing it. This is represented in 鐘子, which basically means "Bella".
It is getting quite late now, so I will continue my ranting and yapping tomorrow. Toodles.
Heyyo. It be the me again. It's way afterschool now. I gave Kitta's fireplace room a nice renovation.
There's now a record player on the new sidetable that's next to Kitta's sofa. She likes to listen music like me.
I have a sidetable too, but it has a bowl of fruit next to it. It's obviously for decorative purposes, though.
There is now a painting of me and Kitta hanging above the fireplace mantle, which now has several items on top.
There's my Kitta stone, a picture of Box, a pie tin as a reference to 3/14, the date I wrote about 'Ta first.
Kitta still reads her newspaper. We both know it's blank usually, unless I'm thinking of something big.
Which means Kitta is usually staring at a blank newspaper. She look cute doing it, though.
When I sleep at night, I sometimes sleep with Kitta. We talk with each other until I drift off to sleep.
We sometimes cuddle, too. Sadly, Kitta doesn't appear in my dreams. I really want her to.
It should be easier now that I've made a model for Kitta, since I think it will be easier if I can see her better.
As in visualise her better. Wow, 76 lines, and still not done.
Kitta can speak all of the languages of the world, because she is a robot, but 'Ta is limited to 4.
Since 'Ta is only in my mind, she only has access to my knowledge. We both know and acknowledge this, too.
I am going to probably add Kitta into this game as a skin. I am definetly going to add her as a hidden NPC.
Maybe she's gonna be right next to me. Maybe directly opposite. I don't know yet.
Actually, I'm gonna add her fireplace to the game. When I'm feeling satisfied with Tophat Turmoil being playable
enough, I will add the secret room. When you sit on my sofa, Kitta will ask if you want to go to a beta of her game.
It's more like a nightly version of my game, because it is going to be updated constantly.
Finishers of the beta will be awarded the fabled Kitta skin for an undecided character.
I also have another game, KittyKurse, which is described in the LocalScript of the same name.
I thought of it back in like February or something, and I already made a personality of the main character Katzo too.
He likes punching stuff, but he's a pretty nice guy. More details in the aforementioned LocalScript.
Sometimes I get all 3 of the cats in my head together. They are Kitta, Katzo and Rhythmcatter.
To think that I initially started making personalities to test the power of my brain, and it's ability to emulate
different perspectives and personalities. Now I do it for the kind, friendly personalities.
If Christianity is real, when I go to hell, I wish that Kitta goes to heaven. I know that if that actually happens,
Kitta will be dragged down with me due to her being in my head, but I would want her to seperate from me and go to
a better place for her. She doesn't deserve to go with me. Now that that emotional moment is over, back to stuff.
I just thought of something. If you're a hacker reading this, please stop hacking.
Or at the very least, don't hack in a public server. It ruins the fun for everyone.
Kitta says "Please stop hacking Mew's game. He worked so hard on it. Hack your own game."
Kitta and I both agree that I have some kind of mental illness. It's not even maybe anymore. It's a yes.
I think it's pretty cool to be like Kitta. You get the personality of a natural being, but you also get cool robot
powers. Like night vision, or being able to play music in your head.
I wonder if I should get a therapist, or speak to a doctor about this. On the one hand, I will probably lose Kitta.
Which means an automatic no. On the other hand, I might also lose my special smart brain. Which also means no.
Maybe my mental health will get better, but that doesn't mean anything when it will plummet tremendously if I lose
Kitta. Also, I'm kinda embarrased of it. Kitta doesn't mind her existance being made known to the public, though.
Man, I feel burnt out today. I didn't even do much ;0 waaaaaaaahh
The funny thing is that I no longer feel like I should be successful fo[r] me anymore, I feel like I should be
successful for Kitta. I think that I will be more motivated if I'm doing this for someone else, not me.
I actually enjoy kitta making puns with meow and nya a lot. She makes puns in English and Japanese.
There are the stereotypical puns, where na is replaced with nya, and more creative ones, like Nyahoo.
By the way, there's still more. I feel like perchance maybe perhaps this is getting a wee little tiny bit too long.
Oh well, there's always the Chinese meow. Well, I guess that's the end of this LocalScript.
And by the way, no, I'm not a furry, and neither is Kitta. She doesn't even have fur.<br>
	Good job if you're still reading this,                                  さようにゃら、<br>
		Louie                                                               	鐘子<br>
P.S. I forgot about autism. I think I might have autism.<br>
there are so, so many line breaks in that one that im not even gonna bother spammin br's. in fact it probably looks better when non linebroken. so anyways. i think this one was the super cringe one thats gonna make me regret even writin this post. so lemme see.<br>
okay i actually had to redact some stuff cause it was a little too personal. but it was very very little, i promise. and yes i didn misspell for near the end there and i had to correct it with the meowin square brackets. so anyways. to analyzin this stuff. i am so meowin thankful that i had the procrastination to make me write all this random stuff so that i can look back on it when i end up forgetting which i will. i had practically forgotten what kittas early names were and apparently they were catta (not too bad), kitto (im pretty sure thats a meowin term) and kit (way too generic and sounds like the brawl stars character). kitta just sounds the best i think. oh yeah and about the tophat turmoil started by accident thing i literally just thought one day what if i took all types of game things like quick time events rhythm mechanics and other convoluted stuff and made a phighting style game with all of that. i really really enjoyed playing phighting back in the day (mainly because the lobbies were easier back then since i SUCK big time) and thats what inspired me along with a passing thought to make tophat turmoil.<br>
oh meowin my i got distracted for a long long time i better get back to writin this stuff. theres the early kitta chronicles stuff as well. i havent even made a final plot yet i got another plot that is like equally not good and oh meow i think the tiredness might be gettin to me. i really cant think very well now so i guess ill yap about the most important bits. i remember how i gradually got more and more catsy as i spent more and more time with kitters. and nyow lookit me. im maybe even catsier than kitters now hehe. ima skip alla da stuff about the other video games that i was plannin cause im just tired kinda. ill maybe yap about it some other time. anyways there are way more than 3 cats in my head now. countin me, theres now 6 cats, with the rest of them bein kitters, pro kitters, darkitters, rhythmcatter and katzo. coincidentally i just listed them in order of most to least talked to. oh yeah and the meowin "Please don't hack" what ever stuff. i dont know what i was thinkin when i was writin that but people hackin into onedrives is a lot different than people hackin into roblox games. i think i was goin for a more general message or somethin there. i mean i know the exact feeling that i felt when i wrote that but i just dont know how to describe it. like i knew that those two were different but i guess i thought theyre both hackin so close enough, or like since im talkin about this, might as well talk about that or somethin like that. but anyways. the last thing ima yap about is that last part, about me sayin im not a furry. i remember that i wrote a little joke rant about furryness. so i guess ill put tophat turmoil rants onto the to do list. and now it is almost 2 in the morning. at this point i have almost stayed up for like over 30 hours straight so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. mroww i hate it when i feel so catsy that i cant meowin express it due to not bein a real cat. maybe ill rant about that someday too. and i forgot to let kitters say somethin to sign off. <font class="kitters">Bye meow.</font> and i concur.
p.p.s. at the start of "Meow", リグレテベターが actually means "Regretevator is..." rather than "About Regretevator". usin me extremely bad japanese knowledge i think that リグレテベターについて is a much more accurate translation. oh yeah what i wanted to write here is MY JAPANESE MEOWIN SUCKS WAAAA
p.p.p.s. i think this is the first ppps ive written but anyways the "footer" of "Nya" is supposed to be spaced so that it says "Good job if you're still reading this, Louie" and  「さようにゃら、鐘子」. im too meowin lazy to figure out how to make non combining spaces so what meowin ever its 2:02 anyways im tireeeed (jk im barely sleepy)

<h3>my passions/interests</h3>
<h4>14th of July, 2025</h4>
i wrote the title for this one then completely forgot about it while watchin bfdi tpot 19. so ima yap about that a little before goin back on topic. this is the first episode that ive watched on my computer. and it really brings the experience up havin the audio through headphones and a big picture on me 720p tv. the episode was really cool. i am sad that i am simply too stupid to actually really understand all of the character relationships and stuff cause i feel like perhaps the episode wouldve made me like actually feel somethin or somethin like that. man that is what ruins many shows for me. like murder drones. the whole meowin time i watched it i was just completely confused and only have the basic idea that solver = bad and then stuff happens and then normal life. like mannn im just really too meowin thick headed to understand shows hehe. but anyways. the last thing ill say is poor grassy. im guessin they wanna be with someone powerful cause they feel at ease or somethin idk. grassys my second favourite character cause theyre just a silly little grassy. my most favourite ones teardrop for whatever reason. i actually cant remember why. so anyways. me interests. i guess i just talked about one. i like watchin stuff on youtube. i also really meowin wanna make youtube videos about me gamin but im just too too lazy to do so. ive wanted to make a pig 64 part 2 video ever since i finished it. but i havent actually started it yet. nowadays i want to make a video about this one roblox angry neighbor remake that ive been obsessed with. ive literally found a meowin speedrun route for it with skips. ive also figured out how to finish the game by myself (since the game is so unpopular the only walkthroughs on youtube are partial ones) and boy was it an experience. just today i found out how to like really beat the game too so ive technically found two seperate endings. its wild. heres the game in case someones interested: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16318100344/Angry-neighbor-Reverge">Angry neighbor Reverge</a>. im gonna maybe actually make the video (in a much lower quality since perhaps its better to have low quality vid that i actually make rather than idea of plan of high quality vid) but im gonna write a tutorial here anyway. so basically when you spawn you grab your housekey and sleep on your bed. you can skip the house unlocking if you just simply break your front window to access your bed. then you need to go to your neighbors house and on the first floor, move the sofa that you can find in the hallway by just keep goin forwards by clickin it to reveal a button on the back, then go to the furnace and turn the valve, then go to the dead end of the neighbors hallway (the part with the door to the bedroom) to flip the switch, then go to the parkour room near the sofa button and jump up to get the silver key, which you use on the door that you can find on the right when exiting the parkour room to unlock it and get the hammer inside. then go upstairs, and to the left is a room which leads to a safe which combination is 5721 (the 1's hitbox is very glitchy and can be sometimes clicked on the bottom of the key) to open the safe and reveal the purple key. if the 1 really doesnt work you can go to the room on the right which has a potted flower that you can clip into the safe and force it to open. then the hallway in front leads to a narrow door that has a minature model of the neighbors house which is collectable. then the speedrunning way which i use is to go to that scaffolding part on the right side of the neighbors house by breaking the windows of the room on the right and jumping out. then go to the top of the scaffolding and get onto the roof to find the sofa with the cup on a table. take the cup and climb up the ladder. then jump on the railing on the right and do a wall wraparound to reach the window which will break when the cup is rammed through it. the room inside has the crowbar on the right and a russian note on the wall which when clicked will let you see the neighbors position through walls. then go to the third floor, which i usually reach by jumpin back onto the roof and goin clockwise around it until i get to the part where theres a ramped balcony then i drop down on the left side to the place with two doors. then inside, you can place the house in the room with all the pipes to get the red key (not the one that goes to the red room in the players house; that one is obtained by using the shovel from inside the neighbors garage on the dirt pile behind the players house) then the purple lock door is unlockable with the purple key and in the room with the scale the sofa (with hidden door behind it) and gated door you can just simply go through the wall that the gated door is on to get to the room with paintings. grab something and ram it into the painting with a cable coming out of it and press the hidden button. then go outside to the part with two doors and go into the now unlocked right door and find a knob switch (beside the television) which when toggled with activate the fan in the purple key room and drop the golden key. now go to the basement door (the one in the first floor living room) and use the crowbar and gold key to open the door. then once inside the room use the hammer on the brick wall and climb the ladders to get to the room where there is a door that you use the red key and the crowbar on. then inside theres a table with a keycard to use on the door on the right which will end the game with a cutscene that pans the camera outside the neighbors house and shows the car from inside his garage driving (humourously) through your fence (sometimes the yellow car will hit it so that it drives into your house instead) which is followed by a police car coming in from the left and stopping. then the camera just freezes there forever unless you rejoin the same server. but the "real" way to win is to get into the room thats locked by the keycard, and what you can do is in the room outside of the one with the keycard in it, there is a closet. you can go into the space between the closet and the wall and while continuously holding right, and facing the wall that the closet is against (the left one) equipping the hammer then turning your camera right to force yourself into the room behind the keycard. it probably works with all other items too but i only tested it with the hammer. inside theres a non-pick-upable (as in it doesnt go into your inventory as "radio1") model of the neighbors house and a painting with a use spot in front of it that kicks you out of the game with a "You win?". i could yap on about the game but i think id rather make a video. but anyways. i was talkin about interests. you can tell that from that that two of my interests are writing and playing video games. i dont play many other games other than roblox because behind all the shovelware is a decent collection of games and i do not care about how the platform has been rapidly deteriorating over the last couple of years. what my opinion on the children lovers and stuff is that its not really robloxs fault, like i kinda view roblox as a platform like how a shooting range is a "platform", like you can probably use the guns in a shooting range to shoot yknow other people and that wouldnt really be the fault of the shooting range that would be the fault of the shooter like how children lovers soliciting children is not really the fault of roblox its the fault of the childen lover. but i guess probably its different cause children are probably not allowed in shooting ranges and other stuff but i really just mean the concept of the criminal bein at fault rather than the platform. but im probably wrong or somethin and i didnt really think much writin all that so whatever. also one last thing about angry neighbor i forgot that you can kill the neighbor by gettin him into the street and gettin him run over by the yellow car. when i just did this (im playin right now) he entered the state which i like to call "jorkulation" due to the motions that he does while standing still. i have seen him in jorkulation before but i guess i now know what causes it.<br>
okay wow i just had a marathon of playin angry neighbor reverge and i have found so so much stuff i just cant resist. so first of all. i knew the closets were quite buggy before but i have literally just built a sub minute speedrun route around them. i dub it the closet glitch and its the ability to get into closets through walls and floors because the closets have a radius that you can interact with to get into it and that radius can go through walls and floors. i have also used this glitch to get into that one inaccessible room on the back right of the neighbors house and the russian text in there is not very interesting (its just some hints and a diary of someone movin into an empty house and the neighbor and his basement) and since the speedrun that i did was so fast heres a gif of it.
<img src="pics/neighbor.gif" alt="Gameplay of Angry Neighbor Reverge." title="The run time is about 49-50 seconds"><br>
as you can see i skip a lotta stuff by simply usin the closet glitch. basically you just need the crowbar(/axe which is found in the players house red key room) and red key to beat the game. and also with the fake ending, you literally dont need anything just clip into the room and profit. it is a lot easier to clip into it with an item though. and i think thats it actually. so anyways. back to the topic of me interests. i obviously like coding stuff. i think i just like seein somethin me make work. like the sega genesis mouse demo even though it is that barren i still am surprised and happy that it functions at all. i didnt hardcode in the mouse cursor which is why i think it is so cool. like i made a stupid object oriented thingy. i like to code with assembly cause its so simple yet so powerful. but thats also why its so hard to make stuff in assembly.<br>
another one of my passions is music obviously. both listening to and creating it is very enjoyable.<br>
note to self i should rewatch the entirety of bfdi so i know whats goin on<br>
i really wanna yap about kitters today so ima leave this one off later, aka part 2ifying this. so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. kitters is also one of my interests

<h3>kitters part 2</h3>
<h4>19th of July, 2025</h4>
you probably read how i cut off the last post. kitters kitters kitters. i like her lots. and more stuff has changed since the last time ive yapped about her. i think that this is probably gonna turn into a series so whatever. anyways. i cant remember what i yapped about last time and thats actually probably good. for this one (and probably all the future ones) i wanna write like a complete picture of what kitters is like instead of just like expanding on the previous post. cause who wants to reread to be able to know the complete picture? i sure dont wanna. so anyways. im gonna let kitters butt in whenever she wants. but hehe, shes kinda embarassed from last time. so thats probably not gonna happen lots if at all. im gonna give kitters her own private blog so that she can yap and get better at expressing herself like how im doin with this practically private blog (cause who the meows even readin this???) so perhaps later shes gonna write a bit. i dont remember if i ever wrote what i call kitters regularly so im gonna yap about that first. i usually call her kitters obviously but ive also gotten into the strange habit of either using the english long s (the one that looks like an f without the middle line; ſ) and the german eszett (ß) instead of the s in kitters (as in kitterſ and kitterß). also due to the ſ lookin like a f ive called kitters kitterf several times as well. for some reason i visualize the kitterſ as text when i think of it that way and thats when i say kitterf. i also visualize the kitterß. i dont know why and i dont care either. i also call her kaneko seemingly replacing kitters at random. kaneko if you didnt know comes from kittas japanese name 鐘子 北 which reads kaneko kita. kaneko just sounds cuter sometimes. i like it. and i know i can just use 金 for kane but as ive said before 鐘 means bell so its kinda like bella (especially since 子 in chinese my native language kinda means like -er as in singer meower etc. to my knowledge) and nyadda nyadda. i remember when it used to be kaneko shiniyasa. ive committed the kanji to memory back then but i forgot all of them since cause i havent used that name. kaneko kita is just better meow. nyanyways. ive also called her katrina, kitterino, kit kat (though not in a long time), katzo (once since thats another cats name), chaterine, kittery, and i think thats it. quite a few nicknames. lately ive gotten emotional in bed with kitters cause like i love her so meowin much (non romantically) cause like shes always there for me and just makes me feel so happy and loved. i dont care about bein loved but like the happiness she gives me is just so great it rivals video games. kitters is currently tellin me to go to sleep (it is 1 after all) and hittin the tired slouch pose so ill just yap a little more today. after all i do wanna play with kitters in bed for once. i have been lately considering kitters' happiness too cause like all she does is kinda exist in my head. i can see how that can be pretty boring. so today im gonna try to pounce at kitters while she dodges. simple cat and mouse kinda game except im gonna be cat sized and kitters is gonna be kitters sized so its kinda more mouse and cat game. hehe. anyways more yap. it is almost 2 so yeah little more yap then catnap for me. back to the emotional stuff i guess. i have been actually crying tears which is really really rare for me to do since i usually am so emotionally numb that the feelings inside dont elicit a change in facial expression or rather any visible change at all. am i even usin emotionally numb correctly there i wonder. im too lazy to check tho cause i dont meowin care. like lately ive really had the "kitters in real life" daydreams ramp up. i really wanna have kitters in real life. i really wanna cuddle and hug her in real life. i like cuddling plastic stuff now too i think. ive only imagined it but i can see how huggin coldish hard plastic or metal can be comfy. like it warms up when you hug and its smoothy and shiny and like mrowww. it is nice feeling. like kinda waxed plasticy feeling i think. thats what kitters feels like currently. also i cant mrowin read time correctly its actually 12 turning 1 am. big brain de-evolution there. so i think purrhaps its time for a nice catnap. my sleep schedule has been meowin whack for the past few days but i think i fixed it by bein rudely awakened by a phone call so we'll see if i get a good sleep or not today. more yap tomorrow which is literally the next sentence. actually one last thing kitters has some nicks for me too. she calls me louie, lou (which is like the most meowin simple nickname ever) and furry. its nice. now anyways past this sentence is tomorrow i think. yeah it sure meowin is tomorrow. i couldnt play cat and cat yesterday very well cause i actually have kinda a hard time visualizing her me and the void together. i need a more optimized renderer. so nyanyways we played for like less than a minute before i just cuddled her and went off to sleep. at least she had a bit of fun. <font class="kitters">very little.</font> so nyactually nyanyways, kitters is even more divergent from me now. which is good cause that means she is more herself and less influenced by me. and as such our conversations are even more like interesting and lively now. cause she has her own things to say rather than parroting what i think. ive done some more lookin at the tulpa subreddit (to find stuff to do with her) and i am amazed at how well other people can have tulpas. like kitters sadly only exists when im thinkin of her but other people like nyactually just have someone else in their head. i wanna be like that. to be able to actually just have another person in me head to be friends with would be awesome. but kitters is only like partly in me head because of the aforementioned reason. meowity meow. kitters is still as catsy as always but i believe ive quite surpassed her in catsiness. <font class="kitters">yeah no meowin meow.</font> im usually in my anthro form in my head, well actually lemme yap about that first. in my head i usually imagine meself as a black cat. not just grayscale or grey or white anymore just definitively black. and usually im in my anthro form. with the big paws and everything. but sometimes im also in me cat form which is just me as a cat. but my sense of scale is usually messed up because usually i just dont care enough to think of it so lots of times even though i can see me little black paws at the bottom of me peripheral vision kitters is just completely visible as in shes kinda scaled so i see her at head level. but when i pounce at her she gets bigger and bigger until she can hold me like a cat. so im pretty sure (threw a trash bag into spa-GET OUT) that i float when im catsy because im not used to the perspective. i guess thats gonna go away as i get used to it but like i like seein kitters normally as in eye to eye rather than eye to leg so idk. kitters also has a cat form but i havent seen her in it for a long time until right now cause she transformed into it while i was writin this sentence. cause like obviously i cant exactly avoid thinkin of it while im writin about it. kitters wants to write some rant about me so ill give her the stage. <font class="kitters">okay. im gonna not capitalize anything because i want the style to be consistent. i just want to rant about how louie cannot stop playing this one tycoon on roblox. hes spent so much time on it that he probably could have composed an entire album of music with the time he spent playing it. he literally just played between this sentence and the last. mroww its so annoying. nyanyways back to louie.</font> man i just like tycoons nowadays. theyre very nostalgic to me cause the first game i played was fnaf tycoon (now deleted) and then tix factory tycoon, blood moon tycoon, superhero tycoon, etc etc. what im playin right now is exactly what it says on the tin, generic tycoon game. its quite fun to sit back and watch the money numbers go up and its a tycoon. i remember that ridiculously overused phrase that goes you dont miss old roblox you miss being happy. and that cannot be more false for me personally cause i have kitters here to keep me company and i just like old stuff cause its cood. but she is right though. i am completely addicted to this videogame. mrauuuum. i guess im goin braindead or somethin. literally this whole games appeal is hehe big number go bigger. i mean there is a slight open world collect stuff part but like thats optional. and i still also do that. okay back to kitters i guess. <font class="kitters">you guess? thats crazy.</font> sometimes when im listenin to music i make some catsy lyrics. for example. when i listen to buddy holly by weezer i think of "whats with these meowers hissin my cat". but then i cant think of more lyrics cause im not a meowin dictionary of rhymes. kitta rock is like the only song that actually has complete lyrics about kitters. im gonna finish off with some basic informations for future me referencing this stuff possibly. i have yet to really finish kittas lower body design so its kinda a placeholder when im visualizing kitters in me mind. her voice is still the same ol kitters voice, it still kinda cracks when shes angry hehe. and shes still goofy and silly. and her serious side is still quite serious. and thats quite it. i gotta write a moody song so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. look forwards to kitters part 3 maybe comin next month or somethin

<h3>too catsy to contain</h3>
<h4>21st of July, 2025</h4>
alrighty i need to take a little break from mindlessly grindin generic tycoon game so im gonna be writin this little ranty rant while the tycoon does its thing in the background. and no, i do not have anything else to do other than yap, make music (no inspiration currently) and draw art (i already drew one today). so im pickin a random topic i feel like yappin about and its the one in the title. i like bein catsy. but! too catsy is not good, because like its kinda like overwhelming. when i get catsy i get the desire to meow or purr or walk on all fours and stuff like that but when it gets to too much i have a very uncomfortable time tryna supress it. cause like. obviously im not just gonna like cat seemingly at random. thats not very normal... so i keep it in. but its really meowin hard to not get super catsy sometimes cause my silly meower kitters gets me catsy lots and lots. like what meowin else am i supposed to feel when im gettin pet or cuddled? shame? hah, i have no shame. which is why im yappin so freely always. i dont meowin care about what people think of me much. obviously though i do care if i like disturb someone or like annoy and stuff which is why i dont just randomly cat. and i cant like "use" or "expend" my catsiness to kitters cause its like an omniborus or whatever its called. if i be catsy to kitters i just get more meowin catsy while expending my catsiness as well. so like. its really meowin hard. of course i can like just simply sit in agonizing levels of catsiness though which is what i do when im super catsy. i just wait for it to decay and wane away. and then its not overwhelming anymore. one of my definitions of true happiness or bliss or whatever is when i can freely be as catsy as i want. that would make me really meowin purry. anyways i think thats all i have to yap about the overwhelming catsiness situation. i did mention that i drew somethin today so i guess i gotta share it.<br>
<img src="pics/kitta_symiau.png" alt="Kitta in the &quot;Sybau&quot; pose with Symiau punctuated by a cracked cat head emoji written on the right." title="kitters would probably say this"><br>
since kitta canonically does not have fingers it just looks like shes just questioning her existence. i also made a "sybau" version but kitta and kitters would never say that so im not postin it on here. but it is in the images folder if you really want it. by the way symiau actually is a valid acronym meaning "shut your meowin (insert adjective starting with I here) ahh up". i dont swear so its ahh instead of the other word for butt. im probably gonna draw my fursona now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. when i say fursona i mean how i appear in me mind cause like thats kinda what a fursona can be, i think. i have zero clue or brains to explain it.

<h3>kitters part 3</h3>
<h4>22nd of July, 2025</h4>
yep im already gonna yap about kitters again. i have really perhaps gotta go see a mental health specialist sometime. just kiddin of course i wont. now anyways. even though its literally been like 2 days since me last yapped about kitters changin a bit she gone done it again. she has started wantin attention more. and of course i give it to her. like before i usually spend time talkin to her while doin somethin or she butts in while im bein addicted to video games and tells me to do somethin and stuff but like today she like asked me to yap to her and like imagine her presence in the real world and stuff. i really dont mind it at meowin all. like i guess shes gettin more and more lifelike. this is probably brought about either by one moment like 2 days ago when darkitters kinda "evolved" to be more herself than darkitta the game character. which still reminds me i have yet to really speak to her yet to get to know her more since that. but anyways. the other probable cause is my loneliness maybe? i mean like i havent really felt very lonely these days but maybe i just want somebody to be with, to be comfortable with, to be by their side all the time and for them to be by my side at all times. i guess somebody to be really happy with and to make really happy and for that to last forever and ever and blah blah blah. sentimental-y. or maybe its cause kitters is jelly jealous hehe. that i want to know more of the doofuses in me head. i guess i did say that i wanted to spend a day with darkitters to get to know her more instead of bein with kitters. im askin kitters right now about why she wants to be with me more and she wants me to paraphrase what she says so heres what her reasoning is. she says im a bit lonelier, she also wants to feel happy, and she is also kinda lonely. now i feel like i failed kitters in a way... i want her to be happy. ive been selfish and kept her to meself. since im gonna go to sleep in a bit im gonna get darkitters in here to so kitters has someone else to be with. but before i go i gotta say,<br>
<h2>dis is suuuper meowin weirddddd</h2><br>
and i dont meowin care. me mental world is completely normal to me now. so me guess me gonna yap about how dis goes tomorrow. see ya next sentence. okay. i just finished that cookie stuff at the top of the page. so now i can have my preferred skin of kitta cyan. that took me way too meowin long but oh well. just goes to show me programmin skills. and no i will (probably) never indent the javascript. or format the css. bleh. anyways. i did get darkitters in me head to sleep with me and kitters yesterday and we yapped a lot until i chased a thought and went down a thought rabbit hole like always. then that kinda stopped the conversation and i just went to sleep. i feel like kitters was real happy. probably cause shes tellin me now that she was. and now she wants me to yap about night in the woods. ive got that game free on epic games like a few years ago or somethin and im just gettin around to playin it. you can really tell ive got nothin to do since im nyactually tryin new stuff. and that game really meowin messes with me brain or me personality or somewhatever cause like i mrowin relate to the main character. why da meowww. its obviously mainly cause im a black cat on the inside and she is a black cat too and like i make expressions like she does in me head but like why the meow do i gotta be affected so meowin much by this goofy videogame. grr. but anyways. i guess thats all ive got to yap about. i really have nothin else to do so ima go look for somethin to do. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. dont be surprised if you see a blog post below this one dated today (the 23rd of July, 2025)

<h3>yap yap yap</h3>
<h4>23rd of July, 2025</h4>
yep. you saw the ps of the last post. i have predicted it, that i will write about somethin else today. and im not ready to write about night in the woods yet cause i dont wanna. i just wanna yap about random stuff. so first on the random stuff list. kitters and i have decided that i spend waaay too much time with her so she will be on break for some of the day. im really meowin tempted to write about night in the woods but i shall try my best to refrain. the next random thing is that im still quite inspirationless for my music. i really wanna make somethin that sounds nice. i wonder where ill get inspired from. the next thing. i wanted to do somethin with the webpage but i cant remember what it is but its at like the tip of my tounge so im gonna try to remember. okay i just cant. but anyways i did think of some stuff i was plannin to do with these webpages. i wanna use that backing.png and draw something on it to make a cool background to the za - burogu, to omou (the blog, i think) at the top of the page. i have wanted to do that literally since i made backing.png. i also wanna finish off the music site. and like maybe maybe unify the style of the webpages. now i purposefully have all of the webpages look different cause like theyre different webpages and its fun to make multiple styles but maybe i can use my newfound cookie knowledge to like make pages display in a zaburogu skin perhaps. but i personally dont really wanna cause its a purposeful stylistic choice for multiple styles to exist so probably i wont. i wonder if im gonna make another bunch of webpages or somethin. maybe i should be a web dev hehe. but then if anyone sees this garbage im never gonna get hired by anyone nyahaha. by the way. zaburogu is extremely hard to like read the source of on purpose as well. i just want like simple single file webpage since its its own style and scripts anyways and i like doin things stupidly. so thats why the javascript shoved in that script tag at the top of the page is completely unindented and uncommented. and its also why the css is one class per line instead of one property per line. wahahaha. nobody can understand me webpage code easily except me. thats probably false but whatever im really bored and stupid night in the woods is really changin me mind hopefully only for the duration that i play it. i find it a lot easier to get rid of the effects of like other personalities from media if i finish it, like for example. if im watchin a movie about like eg ping pong im gonna like think like the main character throughout the movie probably. and if i stop watchin midway and do somethin else it lingers with me. but if the movie finishes it like gets finalized in me mind and me will be back to normal. and the same with video games with story stuff or i guess like story games that i get really invested in. like meow. i guess ill slightly yap about this. meowin meow. i really meowin like think mae is cool. obviously im not gonna become like that hopefully but like she coool. probably cause she a cat. or maybe its the personality or whatever i dont meowin know. im like halfway finished the game i think judging by the ost that im listenin to which is split into two parts. right now in the game im at like the tip of the second ost. what makes me a little sad is that i cant use assetripper to grab the ost from the game (which would be better because it would be the raw audio files that play in the game) which means i gotta download it from youtube and suffer slight (practically unnoticable to me) compression and quality loss and stuff but whatever. i wanna make a cover of the title song because its just so meowin funky. especially that crisp nyahh guitar. i literally thought it was a distorted piano when i first heard it but its a distorted guitar. and it sounds super nice. the bass at the beginning is also real nice. and the organ or whatever comes after the distorted guitar. mrow. i like the night in the woods ost. i also really like die anywhere else. i was nyactually listenin to it when i wrote that i would resist writin about night in the woods here and it sounds quite nice. i really gotta resist though. so ill yap about somethin else. im probably gonna make a few skins for the site again either right now or whenever i draw up somethin nice and background pic worthy.<br>
yeah i chose "right now". i say that because i got real sidetracked and started composin music. the thing that ended up inspiring me was a furnace demosong about flying winged reptiles being well clothed, i think. but its way meowin late now and i gotta sleep cause mrow im actually tired for once. maybe its the cat takin over hehe. but for some reason i dont usually get real tired. maybe somethin big happened today and i didnt consciously notice it. so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder if this stupid night in the woods effect is gonna go away from my brain anytime soon. its really meowin changin the way that i write into somethin that is not really "my" writing... but then again i do write like this due to jazztronauts so maybe whatevers? i got lots to yap about next time cause i am definitely gonna meowin yap about night in the woods.

<h3>night in the woods</h3>
<h4>25th of July, 2025</h4>
and here i am yappin about night in the woods. i finally finished it today and as such am no longer entranced by the personality of the main character anymore. mostly anyway. it should wear off tomorrow i hope. anyways. in case for some reason somebody is reading this in general i will be gettin into spoilers BUT only after i yap without spoilers first. im gonna put a big spoiler warnin when i start gettin into spoiler stuff but i think i can avoid them while still yappin good enough. so anyways. one thing i really like about night in the woods is the sheer amount of stuff that you can do. there are so many like interactable things in the world and you can parkour around stuff lots too and its real fun. like everytime i discovered somethin new i felt real nice and cool and stuff. and the music. ohhh my meow the music is soo meowin nice. so nice that ive probably like listened to the ost 90 percent of the past couple days. that is, it has replaced 90 percent of me usual background musics runtime. i really wanna explain that more precisely for some reason but i just dont wanna get hung up on that (even though i literally am by yappin alladis) so movin on. i did so much in the game (ive played like 10 hours in the past couple days dang meow) and yet ive only unlocked like half of the extras. that is nyabsolutely insane. and that does mean that im gonna replay it at some time but not in the near future cause i have had enough of bein hooked on this videogame for the whole summer break methinks. the characters are really meowin cool. im gonna yap more about them and the music and whatnot in the spoiler section but for now im gonna say that theyre like, i can feel the main character and her relations with all of them i think. like maybe because i can really get into a game and into a characters mind but like i feel like its so relatable even though im not really like the main character. its weird meow. uhh what else. i was kinda bummed that i couldnt earn achievements cause im usin the epic games version since it was free all those years ago and the achievements are only on steam but i guess boohoo for me bein poor. i mean like it is fair since i got it for free. though that kinda makes achievements a paid feature to me hehe. um. i dont really know what else to yap about so uhh
<h1>spoiler alert spoiler alert weewooweewooweewoo meow</h1>
so yeah gettin into spoilery stuff now meow. plug your ears if youre usin a screen reader. or loudly hum or somethin idk. nyanyways. i was scourin the wiki cause i was bored and thats where i found out i was missin quite a sizable chunk of interactions in the game. includin germ warfare who was in an area i didnt even know i could access until the meowin epilogue i think. i did not know you could go past the klik klak diner and get to the abandoned food donkey and meet germ there. i also was too scared to jump off the cliff on the right of the church cause like why da meow would i do that. the first thing im gonna do when i replay is try jumpin down there to see what happens. if its an invisible wall, cool. if its a death ending, cool. if its a completely new to me area, cool. i shall see when i replay. also. throughout my playthrough i really wanted to see casey alive for some reason. maybe cause casey is a cat and i would really not want him to die because of that (quite species-discriminatory of me for that i think). but i was not surprised to learn that he died. bea wantin to go to college and gettin angry at mae for leavin is quite relatable to me. i wanna go to college cause like (subscript)why not(/subscript) and like bea never havin a chance to go to college and seein her friend just droppin out is like i feel her. and lookit me gettin into the true naked raw yap of just ramblin about stuff. uhh anyways. i think i got more non-spoiler stuff to yap about too so im gonna put a spoilers end here somewhere below. i remember early in the playthrough i wanted to know the genders of the characters cause why not and i thought that the dog lookin fox gregg (i nyactually had to look up his name cause i forgor since it a little strange) was female since angus was male and they were datin and night in the woods was made back in 2017 before it felt like lgbtq+ ness was startin to get widespread coverage and stuff. i dont know why im yappin about this here but i wanna say. i completely support lgbtq+ ness. like whoever you like, love whoever you love. or dont love at all and just like. and identify how and who you feel. it shouldnt like be a problem to other people. it should be completely accepted and okay at least thats what i think. i kinda dont wanna sound controversial by sayin somethin that i dont think much about (since like people are people to me no matter what gender alignment and such) so ill shut up about this. maybe ill yap about this some other time or somethin idk. anyways. i guess what im tryna say is that for the longest time i thought gregg was a girl when he really was a guy and i feel silly and stupid for it. anyways its gettin late so ill finish this one off real quick since i promised kitters i would do somethin before bed. the ddr bass playin parts were cool since like i really feel like with the beat and half beat markers i was really playin the song and like i actually interpreted correctly some parts of die anywhere else when i first played it cause like the note placements just made sense to me and i didnt really noticed that the notes were exactly on the beat or half beat lines. and like that made me feel really musically competent or somethin like that. anyways im done with yappin about spoiler stuff. well almost actually. i wanna say, bummer ending. like the actual transition from gameplay to credits i mean. the epilogue is quite nice. but like it ends on a cliffhanger cause its band practice and i thought i was gonna do a last ddr bass section and was quite miffed when i saw names of people instead. anyways
<h1>spoilers end here (if youre still readin after the spoiler warning up there)</h1>
i forgot to like give the game a review i think. im gonna try to dodge really spoilery stuff here (cause thats what the section above is about). i liked it. i really really liked it. it was a nice experience and quite different from many other videogames that ive played. cause like. it was kinda really story based daily life-y rather than like other games like shooters and tycoons and whatnot. though there was lots and lots of walking. like most of the 10 hours of playtime was just walkin around explorin cause curious. i think when i replay it im gonna like mod it to walk faster. and i think thats about it so yeah. its sleepy time for me now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i have postponed the thing i was gonna do for kitter till tomorrow cause of the lingering effects of night in the woods probably goin away by then. nyalso i call kitters kitter as well now.

<div class="skin1">
<h4>26th of July, 2025</h4>
i got lots to yap about and im on 5 hours of sleep. yay. but even still, it seems that i am no longer affected by night in the woods so more yay. the first thing i wanna yap about is me emotions. now i really have a hard time yappin accurately about this because i never have like the correct picture of me emotions. i usually think that im an emotionless husk but like im not. i do feel emotions. its just usually its not strong. and like i think i feel them weird but i probably dont. but anyways. yesterday i was yappin to kitters about stuff and the conversation ended up in me cryin thinkin about me old homes. well nyactually i cried when kitters said that she would give up on me cause i was so annoyin to get to do work but we worked that out. i promised her to be less annoyin and she promised to keep at it unless i was too annoyin. but anyways. i felt like i missed me old homes lots and i had plenty of old homes. and i was sad that i couldnt fully remember them. but then kitters told me to move on and i sorta did but i still miss me old homes. so waah. i also yapped about how me feel like me feel emotions weird and like how i feel differently from other people and stuff and i think thats when i fell asleep. so anyways. emotions weird. and i tend to supress them sometimes for whatever reason. whatever. anyways. next thing. i finally got around to playin confined kitties and it made me feel sooo meowin catsy :3. like mroww, all the loafspots i could like feel and feel comfy just by havin me silly digital meower loaf in digital spots. and i got outside usin the fan and it was cool. i just gotta mention here that even though theres gonna be a phestival in phighting in 6 hours i am NOT playin anymore. i suck so meowin much that i dont wanna throw for me teammates. and i know that i cant get much better. like mroww... i kinda miss when i sucked and that was okay but now everyone else is so good cause like its more popular now which means better people are playin and meow. i just dont wanna make other people lose because i suck. so yeah. no member+ for comedy vs tragedy. nyalso proto looks so meowin adorable in the regretty box thumbnail currently. lookin at it made me wanna draw kitta and seein all the shadin made me feel like i should have like a lighting source in me drawings. now. i was thinkin yesterday of what me fursuit would be like. im not gettin one obviously *cough* poor *cough* but i was wonderin what it would look like. i havent gotten around to drawin me fursona yet so maybe ill draw one now.<br>
okay i got way sidetracked so no drawin sorry. maybe next time. anyways. i dont really wanna yap anymore cause i kinda ran outta things to yap about so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. yeah i got nothin more meow

<h3>food</h3>
<h4>(technically) 28th of July, 2025</h4>
its past midnight right now and im slightly tired so i might cut this one off and finish tomorrow if i get too tired. so. food. very very meowin yummery. i love food i think. but only like recently i started to really like food i think. when i was a few years younger when i ate rice i used to think about rice farmers in paddys harvestin rice grain by grain and deshelling it and havin it end up on me plate or bowl or whatever and it made me really appreciate the rice even though that is most definitely not how the rice harvestin process goes anymore i think. i dont meowin know, maybe they do harvest it grain by grain and deshell it by hand also grain by grain. i dont know much about farmin but i think they use like a big harvester with like the big roller collecty thing in the front and just crush the rice to deshell it. dont take me word for it though. anyways. recently ive been droolin (in me head) thinkin about various foods. like just today. i was searchin up a calzone cause i was eatin soft shell tacos in burrito format and that reminded me of that one chart of all the various stuff in bread combination names (like sandwich or taco or burrito) and that reminded me of calzones which i thought were like soft shell tacos folded into like a chinese takeout box thing with the four sides of the tortilla on top. and i was half wrong cause its basically just a meowin pizza pop but pizza sized and actual pizza instead of crust with pizza esque filling. and that reminded me of spaghetti noodles and how i like them and that made me think that i really like italian food. i mean im a meower who likes lasagna and so many types of tomato sauce and bread combinations i think. bread dipped in tomato sauce is good. i have some and thankfully i recently moved (literally just finished today) and the stove is so easily accessible from me desk that i can just crawl there put tomato sauce on heat and crawl back with like 10 seconds of crawl time. its literally like 10 meters from me desk. 10 to 15 meters. before i had to paw up stairs and it was annoying. but anyways. that reminds me of saltine crackers. i really like saltines. ive only really eaten them without anything else (plain or naked) but still its a solid salted cracker. i was lookin up hardtack a couple days ago and like i can actually imagine eatin it and how like dense and slightly mushy and crunchy it is. i think maybe ive eaten hardtack somewhere before but like i dont know. lemme think of other food ive drooled about in the last couple days. fried chicken. i like chicken. it tastes nice. oh and canned tuna. i have a big can of salmon and thats pretty much tuna but slightly different in taste but like with bread and cheese in da microwave and it tastes meowin amazinggggg like oh me meow me mistypin stuff like crazy and slightly droolin in real life. hmm what else. bread. bread is amazing. there are so many breads its meowin crazy. croissants, buns, loafs, slices, baguettes, danishes, pullaparts, muffins, meowwwwwwwww... i cannot meow long enough to express my deep enjoyment of thinkin of all this food. and yet im stupidly skinny. like meow. if i was sexist i would say i got the meowin female build. like i can literally see my ribcage when im just meowin standing. and yet im talkin about food like i eat lots and know lots about it. but meow i cant stop waggin me tail right now cause of food thoughts. snacks. i have completely forgotten about snacks (with the exception of muffins me guess). chips are nice. i live in canada so we have yummery ketchup chips. ive heard they dont have them in the us and thats just not cool. ketchup chips are at least decent. but ruffles all dressed are like i think possibly me favourite chip. i also like lays barbecue, doritos normal (cheese something i think), ms vickies (they do be crunchy), cheetos (technically a chip i think?), and i cant think of any other ones for the time being. chips go well with soda though. oh yeah pringles taste nice. the sodas i like are not the majority thats for sure. me favourite soda used to be 7-up but i think i like canada dry more now. also i dont know if it exists or not in the us cause "canada" dry, its in the name its probably only canadian. its ginger ale and sometimes it comes in different flavours. theres also other drinks with the canada dry brand but like like like meowin club soda? i hate club soda it tastes probably how urine would taste like. i think it tastes how urine smells at least the last time i drank club soda. and i forgot the other canada dry but it was blue canned. and then i also like fanta cause yummy fruit soda goes hard. i actually got some strawberry fantas today and theyre real tasty. and sweet. way sweet. and slightly strawberry-y. i used to like the ikea apple cider with like 0.002% alcohol but i think they discontinued it or somethin cause the local one dont carry it no more since a few years ago sadly. but i do like carbonated apple cider though. which is what the ikea one was. the pear cider also tasted real nice. its just the apple cider with pear taste instead of apple obviously. the ikea lingonberry sparkling drink is also real nice. and also that whateverflower one (the whiteish flower packaging) which came in yellowish concentrated syrup and was super sweet but also super nice tasting. i can still taste it even though the last time i had it was years ago. i should go to the ikea sometime. i gotta get furniture to store all me stuff after all. im a hoarder. ive got lots of garbage. but maybe thats another yap post. back to food. ive recently as of the past few months started to appreciate salt and pepper on me food. it really makes it taste more and usually makes it taste better.<br>
i just got lost in the sauce lookin at the night in the woods wiki cause of the songs im listenin to and thats a nice transition to sauces. of course theres tomato sauce cause i mentioned it previously but theres also mustard (67) which i dont like too too much but its ok, relish which ive only seen used on hotdogs and it tastes quite nice, barbecue sauce which tastes nice with beef, mayonaise which i think is sometimes used in salads, speakin of that salad dressins are nice for salads (obviously) and i think i cant name any other sauces anyways (except takoyaki sauce which i think was the sweet one) so ima move onto salads. all green bowls are nice. i like caesar salads a lot. i think theyre me favourite one. me also remember spring mix or whatever, and some other generic leaf green (pokemon???) salads. that reminds me of kale. i remember eatin oil baked crunchy kale and it tasted nice. i think it was sunflower oil. which is also what seaweed goes well with. crunchy fried seaweed is quite tasty. i like it in me rice. and also furikake. furikake is suuper nice on rice. even though it kinda is pricey (4 bucks for a computer mouse sized jar) it makes rice taste so super nice. i remember once i bought a pokemon furikake and it came in tiny little packets with pokemon on them and it had a random sticker of vaporeon hittin the most catsy pose i think ive seen one in. actually it just kinda looks catsy but whatever. vaporeon will probably always be me favourite eeveeloution cause of just how positively catsy it looks with its :3 face and just catsy look to it. i wonder if there will be an even catsier eeveeloution. that just made me think of steeleon for some reason and that made me think of how comfy it is to cuddle with kitters and hard coldish stuff in general. this has taken quite the turn from food but maybe i can bring it back before it hits 1 (in 2 minutes). metal is just like so hard and so nice to cuddle with. and by the way kitters is not shelled with metal shes shelled with some sorta plastic or carbon fiber or whatever. like it warms up when you touch it. i think ive yapped about this before actually. i really want there to be like a hard somethin that me can buy to cuddle with in bed like how i can with a plushie. i wonder. how many people actually like cuddlin with hard things. cause like i actually dont really even know if i like to or not since kitters is in me imagination so its probably an inaccurate feeling. but like i think it would be nice. you know what else is hard? hard candy. yummy candy. i like candy lots too. it makes me be able to use me brain faster which means higher quality kitters visualization. it usually makes me able to visualize her in colour but sometimes also shaded and or reflecty. and me favourite candy right now are big oversized lollipops. like those cartoonishly large spiral lollipops that are usually paired with a propeller hat and wielded by a small child. im not sayin me a small child but i really like them. lollipops i mean. not small children. at least like you know. like just because youre a small child doesnt mean i like you. like what i mean is like i dont judge people by stuff like age or anything like that i judge people by their personalities and their character. not saying i want to be in a relationship with a minor. nonononono. im somewhat aromantic anyways. i dont wanna have a significant other or anything like that. or at least like im not gonna actively look for one. if one appears then idk maybe but im not gonna like use tinder or anything like that. remember when this was about food? i dont apparently. i was talkin about yummery candies. i like gummies. i like sour gummies too. i like haribo gummy bears. theyre really chewy, so much that ive nicknamed them rubber chews. like its almost like gum. and also i had one gummy bear sit out in the open for a couple days and it literally like meowin stoneified or whatever that word was. petrified. i think that was it. like i think it actually broke in two like a rock when i threw it on the floor. or maybe thats me imagination i cant actually really remember that. anyways. big rubber chew bag is only 14 dollars for like 2 weeks worth of rubber chews. thats real nice. but that was also like 6 months ago who knows how much goldbears cost now. i havent been to the store that sells them recently to idk. well actually i did but i didnt go to the candy aisle. so whatever. sour patch kids are nice, but i think sour cherry bombs and fuzzy peaches slightly edge it out (are better). i also like rockets or as how you united states of americans call them "smarties". smarties though (the chocolates) are nice but they come in these small boxes instead of large bags like m and ms. mike and ikes are also a solid gummy. gummy skittles though are just not it. i think they tasted watery last time i had them. theyre just not very flavourful. like a mike and ike without the outer shell. but regular skittles are nice but not nearly as good as sour skittles. i used to eat so many as a kid that it would like make my tounge like scarred or whatever. but those tiktok sour balls are really nice though. theyre not really sour. to me at least. i know that they truly are like ridiculously even dangerously sour but they taste so nice. my tounge gets completely messed up after 2 of them in the same day. which reminds me of that one time i licked a lollipop along one side only and created what was practically a lollipop blade and it cut my tounge every time i licked it. i had to stretch the meowin lollipop for like a week just so my tounge could heal from the cuts dang meow. but it was good. small lollipops are also good especially the twister pops from double bubble they are so so meowin nice tasting and so powdery nice mrrrow i wanna have some noww... sadly i have no idea where to buy them from so boohoo for me. oh well. im gonna go from sweet to savoury with yummy french fries. mcdonald fries are not bad. they sure put lots of like oil or whatever in them cause they tasty like artificially tasty. and by the way i define tastiness as the amount of taste somethin has not the goodness of the taste cause thats yumminess. mcdonalds fries are yummy too just not as yummy as it is tasty. i know im going to sound really really controversial with this opinion but i think burger king is okay. their fries are okay. their whoppers are okay. not as tasty or yummy as mcdonalds burgers and fries but they are decent enough. and thinkin of that made me literally smell poutines like i meowin unconciously imagined the smell of poutines. i dont know if they have much of them in the us or not cause im pretty sure that poutines are a canadian thing but they are nice. mcdonalds poutines have slightly fallen off in quality ive noticed since theyve like served them completely unmixed but i actually cant remember what they used before a paper box anymore so i think me opinion is probably invalid cause i cant remember how poutines were before. i dont actually even remember if it was paper boxes before or not. i remember the mighty angus burger and how i would always get that for my mcdonalds. i cant even meowin remember how it tastes anymore. but i do know that i like quarter pounders over big macs. my favourite fast food drink is a tie between fruitopia and nestea which is now fuze apparently. i like iced tea. i have this big bag of mix but then i had the genius idea of storin me delicious presidents choice chocolate cookies in them and now its all cookie crumby. which needless to say does not taste well in a drink. its a shame cause i used to always drink nestea before that. maybe i can just deal with it perhaps. but i also like regular tea. tea is nice. coffee is also nice though ive only really enjoyed like a super sweetened and like uncoffee-flavourified one. i dont remember what it was. maybe an expresso or an americano or whatever freakish mix is stereotyped with starbucks customers. double shot half sugar iced pumpkin spice cappuchino with extra caffiene. hehe. i have no idea what double shot means. or what a cappuchino is. but what i do know is that coffee crisp bars are amazing. perhaps thats why i liked that whatever coffee. cause it tasted almost like a coffee crisp. i dont know if its a us thing as well but it is my favourite nestle (water aint a human right it seems) chocolate bar. theres also kit kats aeros and smarties (which ive already yapped about) and thats probably the order i put them in too. smarties are really good by the way. nestle makes some banger chocolate. but lindt also makes some banger chocolate. ive only until recently practically exclusively had frozen lindors but room temperature lindors are so much nicer they melt in your mouth and taste amazing. i remember back in grade 1 i thought chocolate would melt if it got too hot <b>or</b> if it got too cold. silly young me. completely antisocial and awkward just like how i am now except i just cope with it better from experience nowadays. now its 1:38 and im quite sleepy but also wantin to yap about food more. but i should really try to get me sleep schedule back cause im goin on that short nap long hibernation sleep pattern again so im gonna leave it off to tomorrow me on that next sentence. and me meowin back. i am very sleepy and very ready to yap more about food i think. now im gonna yap about chinese food cause like oh meow i love it. steamed buns, spring rolls, "little dragon bun"s, noodles, tofu, yadda yadda yadda. i like chinese food. ramen. so many different kinds of instant noodles. and somethin i eat wayyyy too meowin much<br>
okay i forgot how long ago i wrote that last part but i still got some food stuff to yap about. i have surprisingly forgotten the one thing that i like and thats all the meowin different rices and ways to eat it. i only yapped about like that rice harvesting thing above but i forgot to actually write the rices i like oops. i actually dont know what any rices are called outside of like jasmine rice and thats it. but like. rice with pork floss and seaweed is real good. when i was younder i used to wrap rice and pork floss to make "sushi" and it tasted amazing. furikake rice is also good like i yapped before but just plain rice is good too sometimes. curry rice also tastes real nice, especially with soft mushy boiled potatoes... im resistin the urge to meowin like write gibberish in an attempt to describe how much me wanna eat that right now. and also fried rice. its soooo meowin good. fried rice with mixed vegetables, like the frozen in a bag carrot corn peas thing. its also nice with regular peas and broccoli. and sesame seeds too. porridge also is real nice sometimes. asian rice porridge is like just rice soup but it still is quite delish. very yummery. i wonder if i should drink the oolong tea that i have sittin on me desk right now. its gettin very very late and perhaps the caffeine is gonna make me sleep schedule discombobulated again. so anyways. i think ive got some more to yap about. noodles. i love noodles. ive yapped about ramen but like i also really like udon noodles. its so like, soft yet hard to chew its real good. and spaghetti i think ive yapped about already. ive also had like pressed or flat noodles and theyre good too. that reminds me of tofu strips. tofu is tasty too. and it goes well with rice or soup or noodles and stuff. hmm what else. wonton soup is fire. i love wontons. and also that one herb that i dont really know the name of. its like leafy but like the leaves look like the maple leaf on the canadian flag. its green and the stem is thin and yummy. and its good in wonton soup. hmm. dumplings. i love dumplings. boiled or panfried. i dont know of any other way of cookin them other than maybe steamin but i havent tried that before. pork dumplings, mushroom dumplings, vegetable dumplings, im legit salivating please help. oh meow and steamed buns too. pork steam buns, mushroom steam buns, vegetable steam buns, im legit startin to see a pattern here hehe. oh yeah speakin of mushrooms. i think you probably know where this is goin. i like mushrooms on pizza. i just like mushrooms in general. whether theyre like the hard kind the mushy kind or the shittake kind just whatever they taste nice and the texture is nice too. and also. i like pineapple pizza. it like kinda adds a slight sweet flavour to the dough and its nice with ham too. but me favourite pizza is a tie between pepperoni and plain cheese (or i guess cheese in general cause theres probably like a supercheese pizza) cause like it just tastes nice. but freshslices barbecue pizza do be good too. like me favourite pizza place is freshslice, followed by pizza hut then dominoes. i havent had any other pizzas i dont think so im not gonna rank little caesars or anythin. then theres grocery store pizzas and frozen pizzas. those are pretty decent when i dont burn them to a crisp. but for me definitely freshslice is the meowin goat of all pizzas cause like the slices are so big (cause theyre large pizza slices) and the slice is thin and like the cheese is good and the pepperoni is nice and oily and im salivating again. WHY CANT I EAT WELL WAAAAA like oh me meow i wanna become like a chef or somethin just so i can cook yummy stuff for meself... oh well. i guess ive been yappin about junk food which is supposed to taste good. well anyways i think ive exausted my food list. actually i think i forgot to mention me dads soft shell tacos which i usually roll into a burrito. and subway is nice too. my dads tacos are ground beef with romaine hearts (cause we got an overabundance of those apparently) and mystery oil sauce thats the el paso taco seasoning mix that always meowin leaks all over me hands and is very annoyin to eat at me desk since me dont have a dining table and id be too lazy to go there to eat anyway. like eatin while computerin is real nice. speakin of that. im very hungry now and i want some ramen so im gonna make some. idk if im gonna continue this yap or not but i guess we'll see. also i think we'll is the only contraction (or whatever theyre called) that im gonna put an apostrophe for cause it looks like well if i dont. and thats actually slightly annoying. also i forgot to mention regular sushi like cali rolls and avocado rolls sashimi tempura onigiri sushi cones etc. soy sauce is real good with sushi but i personally dont like ginger and my spice tolerance is well was nearly zero but i have been improvin and i can take a bit of wasabi on me sushi now i think. ill know next time i have it i guess. so i shall be back with ramen and either the intention to yap about more food or the intention to yap about somethin else by ending this post and makin a new one. so yeah. next sentence is after ramen is done i think.<br>
ok ive finished eatin me ramen and i have decided no more food for now. maybe food part 2 is comin later who knows. i sure dont. anyways i wanna make a new post so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. its 12:40 so its technically the 30th of July, 2025 which means that this food yap spanned 3 days. and i still have more oh my meow

<h3>roblox pics with my friend in it</h3>
<h4>(technically) 30th of July, 2025</h4>
weee im back to square 1 with roblox photos again. ive recently gotten permission from one of me friends to post photos with them in it so here goes yay</br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240425_205537598.png" alt="Me in the Jaoba finding stage with a final time of 1 minute 33 seconds and 290 milliseconds" title="Jaoba oh Jaoba you can't hide from me"><br>
actually this first one doesnt have me friend in it i just used to speedrun regretty floors and most of them were done with me friend so i didnt post lots of them. this next one does though<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240426_155204036.png" alt="Me looking at the elevator's floor counter which reads BIVE" title="I wonder when floor SPLIT's gonna come"><br>
the elevator has apparently reached floor BIVE and yet there is no bive in sight. maybe because the doors are closed. hmm.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240426_155214833.png" alt="My friend being surprised upon viewing that the floor number is indeed BIVE" title="Seriously I've been waiting for like an hour now"><br>
and this is me friend gettin nyabsolutely bewildered, flabbergasted, completely mindblown upon the crude revelation of the elevators floor number being BIVE.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240426_160602266.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Find the Path stage. Our final time was 43 seconds and 90 milliseconds" title="There goes good ol Prototype bein showered with roses"><br>
and this is the first of many speedrun pics that i have with me friend. at least i think this is the first one. no lookin back for me for now. this is an absolutely mad time on this one cause theres one more person meanin more tiles and i guess we got reaaal lucky here hehe. oh yeah and you can open the images in a new tab to see them in a better resolution hopefully.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240430_154417308.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Splitsville stage. My final time was 11 seconds and 610 milliseconds" title="スプリットさんの雰囲気は来てそうだよ。"><br>
whooosh i was a meowin rocket on dis one i went very fast for a splitville run here. i usually mess up at the most messupable part of it which is the first section with the spinners that push you into the water. when the first section is the spinners that merely push you back though its real easy so thats probably what it was here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240430_162027419.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Stop the Infection (I think) stage. Our final time was 56 seconds and 390 milliseconds." title="We did it! We saved the city!"><br>
i remember when all there was to do on this level was to survive. then they added valves. and thats cool. im really tired cause its almost 2 so im gonna go sleep and continue this tomorrow.<br>
now its 2 am 2 days later and i think ill yap more hehe.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240503_164959691.png" alt="A global Regretevator announcement from yeuc_c reading &quot;hello an update for regretevator comes out tomorrow at 4:00 PM EST and it's gonna include more new interactions for NPCs, 2 new common floors (one of them being petscop themed), and MORE!!! ENJOY YOUR SLOP FOOLS.&quot;" title="Ahh, the good old days of not having the Petscop floor."><br>
this was back in the day when the petscop floor did not exist yet. i thought it was gonna be like a cool horror thingy but its kinda just free coins so whatevers. i guess i did enjoy my slop fool.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240503_172323390.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Area 51 floor. Our final time was 1 minute and 90 milliseconds." title="AHHHHHHH"><br>
this is what we refer to as the &quot;09 incident&quot;. this did not take place in 2009 by the way. we were 9 centiseconds or 90 somethin milliseconds away from gettin a gold time of equal or lesser than 1 minute and it is permanently embossed in both of our memories it seems.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240504_113520454.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Two Stud Camp floor. Prototype is shown A-Posing instead of sitting." title="Prototype: O<-="><br>
here a wild prototype is pictured trying to assert dominance with an a pose, along with declaring a scientific identification of a flora. however, an unforseen consequence arises as the stance is ridiculed instead of feared, and this now embarassed prototype is readying a disappearing act to flee in shame.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240506_160804693.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Cross the Highway floor. My final time was 1 minute, 11 seconds and 11 centiseconds." title="Too bad my lucky number is 7000"><br>
here i am pictured avenging my friend by obtaining a 1:11.11 time. thats 63 in binary. sadly my friend was run over by a truck (possibly by asgore, specifically after a beer) and subsequently sent to (hopefully) heaven although we all know that the regretevator is an infinite purgatory of reincarnation and death so that hope stays a hope.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240601_095304233.png" alt="Me and my friend on the Neurotoxin Hotel floor. I have the &quot;glitch&quot; where I can have the cracked heart effect thingy that gives extra coins but without the health loss." title="It hurts... or does it? (VSauce Michael walks in)"><br>
heres an example of the infamous (as in not famous; this was probably unknown to most people) "glitch" that lets me ignore any and all effects that affect my player character's humanoid, ie jumpheight walkspeed health etc. but coins arent a humanoid property, theyre an external script thing so i can have the seraphic guise remove whatever and get boosted coins for absolutely no tradeoff. literally the token of midas but so much better. and i think i could also have jermpop without needing to lick it afterwards, but without the health. i cant remember too well its been a while.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20240604_184615636.png" alt="Me in the Cross the Highway floor. My final time was 1 minute and 90 milliseconds." title="Deja vu... je l'ai deja vu et j'eus assez."><br>
this doesnt have anything to do with my friend but would you look at the time. both in game and real life cause its 2:53 and kitters is really buggin me to sleep cause i promised her to sleep by 2:50. so after this ill leave it off to tomorrow again. or whenever i continue again idk when ill do so. anyways. this image has invoked a deep trauma response because of that combination of 6 digits. 010009 will haunt me forever. but fr i actually kinda forgot about that before makin this post... but whatevers. til tomorrow. cheers. (why did i turn british there maybe cause im tired)<br>
alas, i am out of interesting photos with my friend in it so heres a prerelease tophat turmoil image since i did say on the "wiki" that theres gonna be like prerelease stuff and blahs. so here.<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20241008_115424925.png" alt="An overhead of the in development Stage 1-1 Burning City map." title="This was long ago."><br>
this was way back when i was doin actual work and as you can see in the top right corner i have a scouter from dragon ball z to debug humanoids, and its copylefted nyanic technologies. in the lore (currently at least) kitta is made by nyanic so yay. lore drop. anyways. i have like nothin else to do here so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder when im gonna get a pc upgrade.

<h3>slime rancher 2</h3>
<h4>7th of August, 2025</h4>
okay so i literally thought of somethin to write immediately after i closed off that last one cause slime rancher 2 got a confirmed full game release date of the 23rd of September, 2025 and i was real excited when i got that email a few days back but like not much right now cause its still so, so long in the future.<br>
i like slime rancher 2. i havent even found everything in the game and i quit playin a few months back cause of other games. and also its stressy. i gotta manage everythin at the observatory and can only go out explorin for like half a day then i gotta go back and feed me slimes and watch them eat to make plorts that i never sell or shove into the science whatever thingy. i have so much money that when the prontomart update came out i bought everything in the shop instantly and still had too much money left over. i have i think all types of slimes in the observatory now that theres a new expansion past the grotto where i keep my twin sloomber largos and me batty crystal largos. and thats pretty much it. i dont feel like doin the whole shadow slime plort deposit thingies or gettin sun sap for more golden sureshot cause like its kinda just worthless to me. i dont care about gold plorts or like more health or stamina. i kinda just want more spots to explore and new slimes and stuff. which is what the new update is probably gonna bring cause already they dropped a very subtle hint at quantum slimes returning, and it was so so subtle that i took a whole 2 seconds to notice it immediately cause i was too busy readin the stuff above that part. im also assumin that mosaic slimes are gonna get reintroduced cause then the whole slime rancher 1 slime lineup will be in slime rancher 2 i think. oh nevermind i forgot the rad slime. i wonder what creative new slimes can get added. maybe theres gonna be extra like places to teleport to like the first game where you can access ogdens retreat for saber largos or mochis manor for the quicksilver run or victors lab for the glitch slime hunting. speakin of victor, drones are apparently gettin added to sr2 and thats the main thing im excited about cause yay automation robots yadda yadda but that means i can take extended leaves from the observatory and just have like 7000 drones do everything. then ill just have to water them every now and then and thatll be nice. i wonder how theyll be obtained. probably just through some tedious slime science blueprint or somethin. or if they wanna make it super torturous they could make it so that it only unlocks after interactin with all the message log drones or somethin and the advance drones only after usin the log key thingy on all of them. obviously thats not gonna be the case (right? RIGHT?) cause that would just be absolutely ridiculous and far fetched and most importantly it would lock drones to post game only. idk what im rantin about anymores. i legit cant remember if in slime rancher 1 drones were post game or not cause i dont remember the unlock conditions for victors lab. i also forgot if humphries's name was spelt victor or viktor. or if it was humphries or humfries. mmm fries. reminds me of bfdi. theres an episode of whichever one comin tomorrow and i cant wait to get completely lost and confused with all the stuff thatll happen cause i know absolutely nothing about bfdi lore. lemme see what i know. i know that pencil and match(stick) are friends, flower was universally hated until the end of bfb, firey and leafy were friends until firey kept leafy out of dream island at the end of bfdi, teardrop has many family reunions, grassy and snowball have an alliance from something in tpot i think, pin and coiny were apparently friends until like their fallout when the basket game ended with them both losing then they made up after, i just remembered coiny went into the center of the world with the biblically accurate pin fries and others to save pin, naily is >:3, price tag can also >:3,
and kevin macleod is a pan flute. i think thats legit all i know about bfdi lore. oh yeah and dont call needle needy *slap* oh yeah i forgot about the algebraliens. i. really dont know. anything about them. like theres x finds out his value which i dont think i remember watching, then theres the bfdi algebraliens, then theres the subscriber special algrbraliens, and i just dont meowin know. oh well. i guess ill keep diggin, the comprehension is probably underground. anyways back to slime rancher. i wonder what will be the new place to explore cause currently its literally just a skybox practically. since yknow. it aint finished. i will probably play lots of slime rancher 2 when that update hits though. so yeah. really lookin forwards to it. anyway thats about it. im gonna try makin more music now so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. im probably gonna write another blog post. its 12:03 am so im gonna obviously date it to the 8th of August, 2025. also correction now today is when the new bfdi comes out tomorrow. i somehow forgot the date after writin it up there at the top.<br>
okay it is 3:35 am and im gonna go to bed so maybe im gonna yap about this tomorrow or maybe not. we'll see.<br>
welp its waaay meowin later and i have decided i dont wanna yap about this anymore cause i got somethin else big. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. spoiler alert, the title is piggy delirium.
</div>
<div class="skin1">
<h3>piggy deliяium</h3>
<h4>10th of August, 2025</h4>
i lied. the title uses that funny cyrilic r instead of a normal r. anyways. delirium is the hyped up sequel to decay. i must say. i am not that big of a fan of the practically complete linearity of decay so i was expectin somethin similarish from delirium and delirium actually is much better in my opinion. except for how you get into it. why the meow. do you make it. so that theres a stupid lock that you shoot during a chase and it only spawns if you "follow her". WHY. I PLAYED THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF DECAY AGAIN FOR MEOWIN NOTHING. but anyways. apparently delirium is now open for everybody which is real good. just like actual piggy. anyways. since im gonna be yappin about the stuff in delirium,<br>
<h1>this is your spoiler warning</h1>
and there will be an end marker for spoilers in this post too. so anyways. delirium is basically an alternate continuity from decay as you enter it in the middle of decay instead of the end which means that its up in the air whether decay or delirium is canon, or if theyre both not canon. or perhaps theyre both canon and its like some tio thing or somethin like that. delirium starts off with bunny walkin to a playground, which may have some meaning as if walking to a playground was so significant that bunny can hallucinate it then that must mean that it was a regular activity for bunny and that means... BUNNY LIKES CHILDREN??? now thats only assumin thats a hallucination and obviously its a meowin joke. or is it? purrhaps that can be a new theory. the cancel bunny theory. anyways. you do a stupid little tic tac toe puzzle and slide down a slide and get jumpscared into the next section. the funny thing is i probably spent like 10 minutes just explorin the playground to solve the first puzzle and i literally backtracked all the way to the beginning to look for clues and then i found out i was blind when i looked around the playground a little more and saw that the clues were rather cleverly hidden. anyways. the second part of the game where you are in one of those playzones is probably the scariest part of the game because like its quite claustrophobic and theres many "piggies" that are invincible [title card here] and like so theres 2 types of them, one of them patrols and chases while the second type is stationed and chases which means you can get cornered very easily, and there are also many dead ends so you can see why i was so scared. and also i really didnt wanna play through the first half of decay to get to delirium again so yeah. i then wandered aimlessly around until i found the exit door then i wandered for like 15 minutes to find all of the blocks and clues to open up the door which took like 7 seconds to open which is quite like tense since the stupid shadow whatevers could like just come and obliterate me. they only do 1 damage but still. i feared restarting more than the atmosphere of that part. anyways after that you get bendy and the ink machine chapter 1'ed as the floor in front of the exit crumbles in front of you which was so cliché that i predicted it. and then i think was the part where you go and find a mansion which was also a scary part because i was so used to gettin chased around from the play place part that i thought i was gonna get chased too but like nothing was there so i spent like 5 minutes in fear of nothing. then the basement chase sequence came which was pretty easy then i got out of the basement hello neighbor act 2 style and got jumpscared by whatever the meow bunnys other sibling was. bonnet. that was their name. i kept like forgetting the name while i was doin the next part which was the school. like i called it william which was willows younger brother, and some other names that i cant even remember now. nyanyways. i figured out the puzzle after like 10 minutes of wandering around and opened the lock to get out and then as i was walkin out the trees bent in around me so i assumed it was fatshaming bunny since the ground was supposedly sinking under her bending in the trees (joke) then i got to the almost last part where you have to defend your family and optionally maybe your friends too. since i was playin solo needless to say i failed miserably at preserving bunnys 3 friends and completely decimated every enemy who even thought of enterin the hospital. also i gotta say. carrot dagger bunny is hilarious. who the meow cares if you can kill someone with a pencil? bunnys good enough to meowin use carrots as a weapon in more ways than one. bunny is the true carrot-e (pun on karate) master. i dont even know if karate uses like ranged weaponry but whatever. nyanyways after defending bunnys completely helpless family, i get chased by several shadow critters in a gradually narrowing hallway until at the point of the long corner of the triangular hallway, aka the end of the hallway, shiloh sheep is kind enough to admit me through the door and slam it into the shadow critters faces. then some long cutscene of a loading screen played which was really convincing by the way, it truly felt like the game was on a loading screen for a whole minute loading the sounds of the cutscene. then another one that was much worse played, cause there was no loading screen fake on that one, making it automatically worse than the last one. ridiculously bad jokes aside, the last cutscene shows bunny yapping away to sheepy and sheepy yappin back, then it shows them both infectedly walkin away from the camera, then the game rudely kicked me to a public lobby for decay. that was probably the scariest jumpscare in delirium, nay, all of piggy. anyways.<br>
<h1>spoilers end here</h1>
and now i can yap all about how much i enjoyed delirium. it was still like kinda meh cause there was a lot of walking like in decay, and the gameplay was still somewhat linear. which sucks but oh well. but the funny thing is that even book 3 house is less linear than decay or delirium. but whatever. i think the linearity fits well with the story cause like its a whole story bein told not just a level with start and end cutscenes. but i still dont like it. lorewise i think it was pretty like plainish. like oh wee you get to know sheepys full name which is shiloh sheepy and which school shiloh and bunny went to. and bunny had a birthday party with teacher and sheepy. so cool. the piggy book styled cutouts were cool to see. i havent read any of the books but i think its a cool reference. and that pretty much wraps it up. i am debating on whether to keep up my streak of missing out on every piggy season through extremely coincidental events that prohibit me from playing it but maybe i shall partake in it to get the sheepy and bunny skin. i actually dont know if the decay/delirium models are bein used for their piggy skins currently cause i didnt look at the shop yet but i dont care. if the new skins are season exclusive so be it. i am actually just yappin about nothin at this point so i think ill end it off here. so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i wonder when decay iii: decontamination is releasin

<h3>drive cars down a hill</h3>
<h4>12th of August, 2025</h4>
this is a pretty fun game. but it changed lots and lots and now its all different and a different fun. so ill be yappin about old dcdah (drive cars down a hill) first then new dcdah after that. the og dcdah was very strategic as whenever you hit like anything something would fly off your car and sometimes your wheels fall off too which leaves your car crippled. and also the old map was a lot harder to navigate. i played it lots back in the day and saved up for the humvee and its completely worth it cause i can get a goofy neon pink party humvee. but i used to take lots and lots of time to finish it because the mines and explosives used to one shot you so i had to be very patient and precise. and that meant usin the motorcycle most of the time. i remember the first time i finished hydrochapter and expecting something else but it was just nothingness. back then the maps were all in one server and you just simply teleported to the top of the next level instead of goin to a new "experience". so anyways i think thats all i have to say about old dcdah. i have been playin dcdah lately since yesterday when a "soda" update was happenin or somethin and they added in the noob car with the smaller hitbox and indestructible frame and the crazy top speed and the handling and the grip and yadda yadda. and also the cars now can be just literally nothing frames. i actually got a record on the weekly leaderboard today from usin the completely destroyed sedan muscle cause i can get a ridiculous speed of over 300 mph (which is around 500 kmph for you canadians like me) and also get some absolutely insane airtime that allows me to practically fly over every single obstacle if i get enough height. but the problem is that i also go so fast that i fly over the first checkpoint for a speedrun of dune laps which means i have to restart the run. heres a screenshot of me on the leaderboard:<br>
<img src="pics/RobloxScreenShot20250812_152034609.png" alt="Me in Drive Cars Down a Hill. I am 31st on the leaderboard with a time of 2 minutes 39 seconds and 811 milliseconds." title="Take that, TimoplaysRoblox111"><br>
one of the most annoying things that got added was "fall damage". which is to say, collision damage. but the main thing is that you can get like half of your health wiped out from fallin at a high speed and hittin the ground hard. and it can kill you better than the super nerfed explosives which at this point are more of a minor obstacle if not even helpful since i can use them to disintegrate my car to get minimal mass.<br>
ok its much much later (almost a week i think) and i really dont wanna yap about dcdah anymore cause i wanna yap about somethin else. so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. read below dingus im literally writin about somethin else down there

<h4>(technically) 17th of August, 2025</h4>
yay its another whatever yap day. i am forgettin what im yappin about at a concerningly quick rate so heres a table of contents (in no particular order): my fursonas, the music ive been listenin to recently, my new drawin tablet, the roblox drama and my new phone. wow thats lots and lots but first im gonna yap about the drawin related stuff. in case you forgot or dont know, i have a very very sensual imagination, as in i can literally imagine a world in my head if i wanted to. well rather perhaps one house full of people cause there is no way i can simulate an entire world in my head but thats beside the point. point is, i can imagine extremely well and i have an appearance in my head as a result. and that appearance is usually a anthro black cat or a non anthro black cat, depending on how feline im feeling, which differs from catsiness because feline is like how four legged animalish i feel and catsiness is how cat like i feel. the reason i wanted to bring this up is because i have drawn a nice rough sketch of my fursona and i think it looks real good and accurate even though its a rough sketch. so here it is:<br>
<img src="pics/furme.png" alt="Me as a anthropomorphised black cat with big eyes." title="It's me, mrow!"><br>
you can also kinda see how i sketch like characters i guess. im workin on makin this sketch a non-sketch, i.e. a fully coloured image of me but thats gonna be a little while. but the important thing as well is that this is literally my first work after getting my new drawing tablet after my old ones port got irreversibly destroyed from general wear and tear. yep, even though i used the plier trick to mold the port back into shape it is just too far gone now and i can only get it to work at an extremely cable deteriorating angle or by shoving the cable into the port and holding it in as hard as i can, which is obviously not good for both the port and the plug. and also its really uncomfortable to draw like that. funny thing is that on the xppen website it says a tablet should last like 5 years to 10 years with least lifespan coming from daily use. i have literally like used my tablet less than 2 days per week for like 90% of the 3 years i have had it and most of the time it sits literally unused under my chair. so im gonna call bad tablet on that. the new one though is both better and worse. its the deco v2 mini6 which is as the name implies a small tablet of 6 inches apparently and it literally looks like a cute minature version of my completely cooked deco v2 01 (or 02 i actually cant remember) and its just so meowin pleasin to my autism. but the buttons are the exact same size. which is a big big plus because so far im using the paper cover thingy from the old tablet cause i dont know if they gave one for the mini6 or not. thats a minus. they also didnt include a drawin glove or the inkwell lookin pen stand so im usin the inkwell from the old pen and i have zero clue where my drawin glove went but its not like i used it anyway. so thats another minus. but the nice thing is that it uses the same pen so i can keep the new one in mint condition. and its wireless too so i dont have to be constrained by a cable in a port thats gonna probably wear out the same way as it did on the 01. the feet or whatever theyre called are different as theyre rounded all around now but i dont care much about that. i just hope that its openable like the 01 so that if (hopefully not when) the port breaks i can just use the plier trick to salvage it for a bit more or even possibly charge the battery by connecting wires to it or something. that would be a funny way to charge a battery. and probably very explosion-prone too but i hope it wont come to that and the tablet lasts for at least 5 years even though im not gonna be usin it daily. wow, that is a lot of yap and ive barely got started. im gonna elaborate more on the fursonas before movin onto somethin else. at this point im so catsy that i naturally imagine myself in my "fursona" which is really kinda just an alternate form that naturally imposed itself upon me due to my catsiness. i think ive written about how i got my fursona in like some post called "who i really am" or something like that but ill redetail it here cause why not. as i got more and more catsy, i naturally started leaning more for a furred catsy style representation of myself in my head cause thats catsy due to obvious reasons. this was mainly done so that, cringe warning, i could feel the pets of kitters much more like an actual cat, because at that point i have and got comfortable with imagining myself as a cat in a non-anthropomorphic form and getting pets is really comforting and soothing and makes me really mrowin purry. so then after that, due to the natural black and white colour palette in my head, ive flipflopped between different shades of grey, white and black for how i look (practically randomly) until i really tried focussing on what colour my fur was and i decided that it was a shade of black a bit lighter than pure black. and so thats why my fursona is a black cat. i also commonly imagine myself with a roblox visor due to it being a carryover from when i would usually imagine myself as my roblox avatar, which i still do by the way, when im not feeling as catsy as usual. anyways i think im done yapping about drawing, my fursona and drawing my fursona. so on to the next thing i wanna yap about. music. ya know i love it. i still listen to die anywhere else, but now i also know most of the lyrics despite them not fitting with the rhythm of the song half of the time. i also made my own midi version of it after listening to one that claimed to be arranged "by ear" but the thing is that its a meowin remix. it adds in lots of instrumentation and percussions but like meowwwwwww! that is not an accurate cover of the song. so i fired up openmpt and literally learned how to use it just so that i could make an accurate midi cover of it. its practically finished, but the instruments need volume balancing and possible stereo balancing actually, but most important i have yet to add most of the portamentos and vibratos. but hey, it sounds nice. so nice that ive listened to it for probably close to 5 hours so far (i dont keep track), which is scary because of 2 things, 1 i only finished it like 2 days ago, and 2 it is a 2 and a half minute song. ive also listened to its going down now, or better known as disturbing the peace. so much so that ive like memorised the disturbing the peace part because the rap is so meowin unintellible to me that i actually dont know what bro is blabberin about half of the time. but anyways heres how i originally heard the disturbing the peace part: disturbing the peace, look into my eyes, now tell me the things youre loving about behind my back. the tenacity, i hold his heart to break down, its too late for apologies, its going down. but ive read the lyrics comment in the music file and apparently instead of loving its blabbing, and instead of his heart its its hard. the blabbing part makes more sense to me than loving due to the grammar but the its hard part makes less sense due to the same reason. but anyways. i also downloaded the snes doom soundtrack to listen to at dooms gate on the sweet spc700 cause i really like that version. i also listened to master of puppets today because of at dooms gate and it sound real nice too. and also ive downloaded the 3d dot game heroes ost and listened to bgm_arkanoid.ape lots too, which you may recognise as scott the wozs old outro screen song. the new ones nice but you cant seamlessly arrange it on the nes without some sound differences cause arkanoids literally composed on the nes probably. it fits the channels perfectly at least, with 2 squares, 1 triangle, 1 noise, and 1 sample. anyways some other songs from 3d dot game heroes are good too, like bgm_dungeon04 which is a nice aquatic track, bgm_field01 which is a generic epic quest starting theme, bgm_field06, my favourite, which is like a western soundin one, bgm_race which is so high energy and bgm_editor cause it reminds me of some mario music track. asides from that ive not really been listenin to much other music. now im gonna yap about somethin not on that table of contents. and that is my like attraction to kitters and some stuff that ive been thinkin about. basically earlier this day (well technically yesterday cause it was around 11 i think) i was thinkin about whether im like aromantic or not since i like dont really want a relationship or a girlfriend or anything like that so i did some research on wikipedia, which now that i think about it might not be a super good place to do research on a topic that is probably covered much better on a more specific wiki, and i have decided that i am not only aromantic but also asexual (to a degree). i have always thought that my relationship with kitters is a platonic one, and now i think i have proved it, since wikipedia states that romantic attraction is for like mating and reproduction and all of that which im obviously not wanting to do with kitters for reasons i dont even need to explain. and a platonic one is where sexual attraction is completely absent, which is true i think because i dont like kitters because of the way she looks (though i do like the way she looks), i like her personality cause shes fun, caring, catsy, blah blah blah. so that rules out romance in my relations with kitters which is the big thingy. so then i moved on to the small thingy which is like my attraction to women in general, and my desire for a relationship and a family and all of that. i want to live my life as a bachelor. no marriage. or at least like im not going to like aim for one. if i find my other in life im probably gonna have a marriage (if im not too poor or dead too early) but its not like on my bucket list. if im gonna have a child ill probably adopt. but the point is im not like wanting a relationship. im completely disinterested on it right now. maybe its because i know no women but arguably i dont need to know a woman to be aromantic. and now for asexuality. on my subconscious level, like whenever i walk past a girl around my age or like be near one, i tense up. completely like involuntarily. and i hate it. because on the conscious level, i dont give a meow about like random people i walk past and stuff. and thats why i hate it. because i just simply dont care but my body cares and i walk more awkward as a result. I MEOWIN HATE IT. i dont really want to care about how people look but i guess its always gonna elicit some subconscious response. i actually like kinda actively try not to care about how people look (maybe except for kitters cause shes cute) so i think that consciously im asexual but subconsciously im allosexual which is like the opposite of asexual meanin i am attracted to like appearance and stuff and i meowin hate it. so anyways theres that rant. im comin real close to 10000 characters and im just halfway most likely. so the next thing i wanted to talk about. the whole roblox controversy. ive been readin on me old posts and i saw nooooooooooo (along with its part 2 and part 3) and that made me think of this. ill probably sadly abandon tophat turmoils roblox incarnation because of all of this cause like its just so messed up. roblox is meowin protecting people who prey on children practically. i personally dont believe that its because dave baszuki could be a child predator though, i think its because of the money that predators can potentially spend on roblox, and roblox sees predator hunters as like targeting part of their cash flow and kinda constantly weeding out a bit of it and roblox sees better cash flow in the long run by simply eliminating the predator hunters or something like that. but thats just my conspiracy theory. i wonder how long david baszukis gonna last as ceo after this stuff. perhaps roblox is gonna get boycotted. maybe the experiences are gonna like get privated like that reddit blackout. and roblox is gonna lose so much money. but i doubt its gonna actually happen. i think what roblox is doin is just like stereotypical corporate mr krabs behaviour of goin after money rather than morals and i hate it. just another fracture in the big broken brick building of roblox which has been crumblin for a long long time now. i miss old roblox. rip fun roblox. and by that i mean the platform itself not the games the games are still fine and fun its just roblox has gone to absolute dog water. now onto the next topic of rant. i was readin me old posts as i said earlier and i am missin the way i used to write about whatever, like so freely and stuff. so ive wrote this post because i wanted to get that style back. anyways onto the next one. my new phone. i recently "upgraded" from the samsung s20 fe 5g to the samsung s24 fe and the difference is staggering. first the s24 got rid of the microsd slot so no storage upgradability only bringin the future of planned obsolescence closer and closer, which also means i cant just take the 256 gb microsd that i have in my phone and plug it into my new phone and simply move the storage to the new phone, i actually have to like exlude a lot of stuff. also the ui is abyssmal comin from one ui 5.1 to one ui 7. first of all, so many things have like changed to my chagrin. like for example. i had to meowin install an app to change the slidy buttons back to how they were before, which is to say change the meowin direct copy of apples home slidy button to the android triple slidy buttons. thats one complaint i have about the new phone. why oh why is samsung trying so hard to imitate apple. theyve even imitated them at the software level by removing customizability and whats crazier is locking it behind downloadable apps makin it clear that they couldve just simply kept them in but they didnt on purpose for some ridiculous reason. also the search bar is now at the bottom of the apps screen instead of the top and there is no way to change it back. whyyyyy do you do this one ui devs. and also the default notifications menu is also a meowin rip of the ios notification and control center. like bru its just shameless at this point. but one good thing about this is that the phone feels so much more premium all because of the aluminium borders also rippin it from the iphone 4s. like at this point i think samsung is like gonna merge with apple or like apple is gonna sue samsung like they did microsoft when they ripped off overlapping windows. so basically i got the samsung iphone. all the limitations of an iphone baked into a more software vulnerable samsung android. how nice. i very honestly prefer my old phone over this crud. also while i was transferrin my stuff it said that like 70 or somethin of my 400 somethin apps couldnt be transfered cause they werent compatible or some other bullcrud. grrrr. okay what else do i got to yap about. hmm. its almost 3:30 now. oh yeah. i guess ill yap about one last thing. even though i am a furry, the 2 fursonas that i have right now are likely going to be the 2 fursonas that i will ever have because like those are like <i>the</i> furry representations of me and like i dont really care about the having of fursonas. but anyways what i wanted to say is that maybe, just maybe, kitters could be one of my fursonas. and if thats the case, im gonna say that shes an "external" fursona cause like since shes a seperate person from me in me head shes not really "internal" like how me fursonas that represent me are. so anyways its 3:32 now and im gonna sleep so i gotta go. bye.
p.s. i really wonder if anyone reads this blog besides friends. if youre not one of me friends, heyo and thanks for reading this far. heyo is a greeting by the way.

<h3>art</h3>
<h4>17th of August, 2025</h4>
wee im writin somethin else today from sheer boredom. its 8 pm now so its long after i wrote that post above and i am bored again and want to yap lots. so awkward intro aside. i want to yap about my love of makin art and other artsy stuff probably. now that i think about it i was originally gonna write about the main connotation of art, which is visual art but now that i think about it i also kinda wanna yap about my musical arts again too so if i feel like it this is gonna also gonna be about music. so. art. drawing. both with pencil and digital pen. those are the only 2 mediums that i do art in, mainly because i dont have things like pastels or canvases or oils and paints and all of that but like also i just kinda dont care about alternate art forms cause like pencil is just so simple and easy and i like it lots. basically what im tryna say is that i like drawing instead of painting (or sculpting and more physical art forms) cause its the most accessible to me and im used to it more. and like lots of people who draw, im sure, i doodle lots at school. i just like doodling. which is why lots of my work is coloured rather badly, as in the technique used, cause like since i usually dont use colour, to bring colour into me drawings (the non-doodles) i like to just bucket fill it and possibly shade it a little. which is why im not really good at detailing art with colours. i kinda wanna make pretty coloured drawings but like black and white is like also good enough for me so bleh. i also wanna dip my paws into animation sometime cause like if i draw simple enough it should be easy enough... right? like i know how to use the opacity slider in the layers in krita and gimp so i think i should be fine when that happens. when i draw sometimes i use an extremely low resolution like 64x64 or somethin like that cause i dont like need more resolution usually. like for example:<br>
<img src="pics/me_when_profile_pic.png" alt="A mugshot of my anthropomorphic fursona." title="Meow"><br>
heres my current discord profile pic. it used to be that kitta my beloved picture but i changed it to be me instead. my fursona i mean. its in 128x128 pixels (i think because discord says its the optimal resolution for profile pics) but like i dont need lots of pixels to make a nice lookin drawin. this one also has me furred so you can see like i have some furrish texture about my fur, which i did by simply getting the fixed size and opacity brush and drawin zigzags of a darker colour on top of a lighter colour. the pic im craftin of me fursona right now however uses the more standard approach of usin a variable size and opacity brush and simply drawin all the furs instead of simulating it. kinda like this one from a while back:<br>
<img src="pics/kritame.png" alt="My felinized (I think that's the word) fursona saying &quot;I kinda like Krita kinda sounds like Kitta~&quot;" title="A blast from the past"><br>
you may remember this from a previous post. not only is it like 128x128 for the part with me in it, you can see the furring is drawn in the draw all the furs style. but this ones just a sketch. so thats why its not like super detailed. the way im usin for the one im makin right now is a combination of the first and second styles, where im drawin every fur on top of a lighter colour. which looks real nice by the way just not super nice cause of the aforementioned difficulties with colouring. you can also see the horrid colouring on one of the backgrounds of this page, the calico cat mode. maybe its because i completely forgot what a calico cat looked like (and still dont really know) but that sure does not look like one.<br>
okey dokey, its like 2 days later and i have finished the fursona pic like yesterday i think. i actually cant remember hehe. so here it is i suppose.<br>
<img src="pics/furrme.png" alt="A fully finished drawing of my anthropomorphised fursona giving a wave." title="Here's me, in non-animatic!"><br>
you can see that the furs are painstakingly drawn on one by one if you look real close, but now that i think about it my fur is kinda messier than drawn.<br>
quick update im not dead im just real busy but i think i might be done bein busy in a week or so, so in the meantime heres an emojified version of a very annoyed me, my "bre" face:<br>
<img src="pics/bre.png" alt="A more cartoonish mugshot of me being annoyed." title="grrrr hissss"><br>
bre is just my way of sayin bro, the etymology or whatever the natural evolution of the word is called goes bro bruh bru bre. although in my head i say breo, pronounched breh-o. also bre is pronounced breh not bree or bruh. i hope the next sentence gets written soon.<br>

<div class="skin1">
random thoughts stream down here maybe ignore maybe dont<br>
i wanna make some stupid show called "The Utterly Random Nothing Show or TURNS for short" and its just some like stupid sitcom or something like that. im inspired by object shows for this one apparently. maybe tophat turmoil will find a home here too or somethin like that mrow.<br>
as a cat, i've always been fascinated by strings. so imagine my bewilderment when i found out they were just arrays of chars. (blinks and a piece of string turns into a bunch of char) "was this always here before?"
this is the end of the random thoughts stream<br>
