<h4>piggy 64 part 2</h4>
okay, i just got done with the 3 keys for that door in the warehouse in pig 64 part 2. and i am SO excited that i cant wait until i get to my other pc to finish that other blog post i was writin about tophat turmoil lore and push that so that there would be no merge conflicts. thats right, id rather git merge than simply wait a few hours and finish up that other blog post to write this new one. you may have noticed that this is in a temporary document for now. or you may not if youre readin this after i merge this to the blog. this is so that its super easy for me to merge instead of having to manually like edit the stuff that git spits out when the local copy of a file is different than the remote one. anyway enough blibber blabber i wanna meowin write about pig 64 part 2. the very meowin first thing that i saw when i joined instantly made pig 64 part 2 better than pre part 2 and i think you can guess why. they added a cat. and i was absolutely meowin estatic. then i went to the port after doin that extremely short fetch quest and i saw that my hard grinded small stack of piggycoin was worth like nothin in part 2 cause they use dollar bills. speakin of i wonder what will happen when that boat captain tries cashin in that cheque. anyways the first big thing i found was an obby. there were finally platformer stages and they are meowin fun. because they can be completed normally or there are many little shortcuts that you can use to shave off more time. and then i spent about an hour tryna do the beach obby or whatever it was called. i didnt even know there was other stuff. like i spent so long tryna do the obby by the time i had finished i could literally buy ace axolotls entire stock and still have money left over. so then i did some more exploration stuff got a lot of the collectibles yadda yadda yadda. i tried doin the whole thing without lookin at a tutorial or anythin and i almost did so. i was so meowin close. the only part i got stuck at (well the only one of two) was the treasure map thingy. i thought i had to dig up somethin (like many people in the server) to no avail. so then i looked at kreekcrafts stream and still nothin i think. i actually cant remember ive got the memory of a goldfish. anyways it was either a chatter on the stream or someone in the server that told that one of the trees at the place with an x has a tiny door in it and you need a small potion for it. i looked in both the normal and other world before that and the best i meowin came up with is that some of the trees look like they form an x so i should dynamite it. i am not very meowin smart. so anyways some guy in my server was also spamming the code for the keypad which i would have never gotten in a month (not a million years, its only a 6 digit code and letsgameitout josh can brute force his raft keypad code in a few hours i can do it in a month) and then i got the bone to give to darcy dog or whatever theyre called. and then when i saw the fnf arrows onscreen i got super meowin excited cause i do love fnf but then it went by at light speed and i thought Oh dingus i gotta spam quite a bit But then the stupid cooler or whatever it is came and instead made me do the stupid memorization minigame with the dances. if for some reason you want to know how to do the stuff ill put all of it at the end of this post in the p.s. section if i can remember (which i probably cant). so anyways after fixing the key and unlockin the door i did the detective minigame thing and the sound puzzle thing and i finally got into the warehouse where i saw poor ryder page and his 2 identical twins being beat up by the blind mouse septuplets. then i had no idea how to do the keys for the big door so i looked around and i found 2 tiny benches which did absolutely nothing even after i shrunk down. i also managed to find a collisionless place in the wall which i could use to just clip out of the map. then i looked on the piggy wiki and went down a rabbit hole that ended up in me watching this guys tutorial videos on how to get the first 2 keys. the first one for flee the facility was quite annoying cause i had to get 2 whole alts into my private server so that i could do the thingy and it took me like an hour to find all the books cause i really did not wanna use a tutorial. i still ended up usin it though and then i did all the stuff to get to the arcade game and i gotta say. even though it was thrilling to play the maze i MEOWIN HATE IT ITS SO ANNOYINGGGGG like the stupid pig heads lag. why the meow do they lag so meowin much. and also in my first hourish of doin the maze i thought the goofy glitchy synth that the pig heads emit was part of the meowin song that plays in the background. i literally thought the song was cool because it had those sounds. so then i figured out that the pig heads were actually easier to track than i thought and i finished it after another meowin hour cause i was too scared from not knowing where they were before that it left an impression on me and i was paranoid for the rest of my runs. and then the finish screen was really meowin satisfying, like really really happymaking. and then i did the tower heroes one. i used to play tower defense simulator before it changed into pretty much a differentish game, or at least the vibe of the game changed and i stopped playin after the update and it left a bad impression of td games on roblox for me after that i think. at least like i had a more negativeish feeling about tower heroes. but its a fine game. i guess its just not my thing anymore. like i used to play tds so meowin much and now i dont like it anymore. oh well. anyways the thing was pretty meowin fun. the chef upgrade tree in the pig 64 island map is a little weird to me though. like pony to zizzy to willow to piggy to mr stitchy is a little strange i think. like why not georgie then pony then zizzy then willow or doggy then piggy or something like that i dont know. also willow has an axe. that is probably non canon. like why not doggy cause he has an axe in forest. strange strange. i embarassingly did not get it first try cause i guess i suck at tower defense games after not playin them for a few years. what i really like about the tower heroes stuff though was how when you collected an item it was in the style of pig 64. but enough about tower heroes. this is where it really made me happy. after i followed the second tutorial i looked on youtube and saw a livestream by a dingus lookin for the third game. and when he pulled up the hinty hint i instantly thought of phighting cause of the words Crossroads And Fight And how there was a subspacey thingy in the background. then i remembered that phighting had no new badges. well actually the people in the chat were spamming that i was too lazy to look in the badges cause i was doin somethin else while watchin the stream. then i saw that it actually was phighting and it was the vine staff badge. and then i had to reload my private server like 3 times to get the door behind the library to spawn (or was it some other building i cant remember the one next to ranged royale btw i dont mean the library that has 7gbo kit or whatever hes called i mean the one with cozyshot) and then i went to town destroying the lobby and i was legit expectin to have to play coil cause again goldfish memory caused me to forget it was the <b>vine staff</b> badge and i had lots of fun beating the dingus like an hourish ago from me writing to this point. and i cant remember their name. how surprising. anyways since i actually play phighting and i also happen to main vine staff along with skatey (i cant aim anymore i aint playin medkit ever again) i beat the boss on the first try. as in without dying. i actually dont know what happens if you die. it was very meowin exciting. and then i got the last key the omega key then i went back to pig 64 in warehouse and opened the door and was greeted by "". actual  , %20, 00100000. meowin nothing. then i looked back at the stream and saw that its actually comin out at 4pm est tomorrow. so i have to wait. but still. pig 64 is just so meowin fun and exciting. like i havent been this excited since the last phestival in phighting. oh yeah that reminds me i think theres also another one tomorrow. i may or may not play it depending on whether i feel bad enough about my inevitable throwing or not. but choices. do i play pig 64 or phighting. i have zero meowin clue but i probably will tomorrow. so nyanyways i just wanted to yap about pig 64, thats about it, so yeah. i gotta go. bye.
p.s. thankfully goldfish memory only enacts itself upon me after like 30 minutes or somethin so i remembered to write down the steppy steps here. so here ya go.<br>
This guide assumes that you have completed Part 1 of Pig 64.<br>
You must go to Grassland and go to the docks and talk with the captain. After he asks you for bills, turn around and collect the check right in front and above you. Speak to the captain again and he will take you to the pier. Now you need to grind for lots of money. The easiest way to do that is to buy a fishing rod from Ace and fish a lot. You need the hammer, the wrench, the dynamite and the lockpick. Go to the sewers on the right after that and open up the door to get in. Now you need a shrink potion, craftable with 5 Tasty Drinks, 2 Grapejuices, 77 Piggycoin and 77 Bills. Now go to Grassland again and go between the lighthouse and the lake with the island, where the trees are. Find the tree with a small door in its trunk and use the small potion to be able to go through it. Go up the stairs and input 6845 on the keypad at the top to get to the chest to get the bone. Go to the Pier again and buy the emotes Shufflerock, etc etc i cant remember this stuff fill it in later. Then talk to Darcy Dog while holding the bone and trade with her for the key. After watching the cutscene,
