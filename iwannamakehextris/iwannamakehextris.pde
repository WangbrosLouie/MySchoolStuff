/*no code yet but i got some ideas for now
hexion uses a goofy grid that doesnt exactly prove easy to implement
ive gathered that i should use a horizontal line based approach
instead of a vertical line approach as a line in hextris
is 2 fully filled adjacent "lines", and it is easier to do stuff
horizontally because of that. the grid's border is 20 blocks tall and
13 blocks wide. the playing area is one block taller than
the vertical border. i have literally zero clue how to code this in
so its probably not gonna be finished. oh well.
