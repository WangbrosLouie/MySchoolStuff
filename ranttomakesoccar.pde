/* heyo, i have a serious problem with this stupid physics library. in
roblox, every object is its own object in the world, being manipulatable
through many functions accessible even if the function is of another object
but fisica. ohohoho. how the heck do i even use this thing. so every object
in fisica, i add to the world after creating it instead of it just being
created into the world, then i can also add it more than 1 time and it
makes the same object in the world but not at the same time? its just so
different from roblox.
oh yaya, i think i figured it out a little better now. i know now to never
use arrays with these as they dont work, so i guess i gotta learn arraylist
to have arrays.
ok i think im ready to write the rant today. i dont got much to say so i
guess im gonna talk about drive ahead sports. that game and the original
(unupdated) drive ahead were a large part of my childhood. but now im
playing drive ahead sports again and the super soccer is so fun. it reminds
me of captain tsubasa. and now i think im outta juice again. i dont wanna
delve too deep into my game yet because i think i should finish it more at
least. oh well. i guess dont count on there being another rant next time.
oh wow, that finishing bit was just the perfect length. too bad im ruining
it heheh. anyways the flames of yap have been rekindled and i am once more
ready to write this time about music. as all of you dont know my playlist
in foobar2000 is currently 4277 songs long with 13.6 GB (14668132876 bytes)
of music. some of them are duplicates, some of them point to relocated
files, and some of them are the couple hundred sfx minigsfs from gyakuten
saiban geemu booi adobansu ban. i wanna pick what i think is the best song
from each game in my playlist. starting off with phighting. i think ttyl
is the best song in the ost. theres a reason why its the first song in the
playlist after all. after that comes the only regretty song here cardboard
labyrinth which i like cause it sounds like an opnb chiptune. then after
that comes my game and i think that too much stuff n stuff is the best song
because it sounds the most complete even though its unfinished (read: can
be extended) and the notes dancing together sound quite nice. after that
is a bunch of random songs and then comes drive ahead sports which is
grent_looped of course. then from dragon ball z chou gokuu den totsugeki
hen is "Get Them, Goku, My Grandson!" which is actually titled
"突激！孫悟空" (sorry non japanese fonters) which romanizes into totsugeki!
son gokuu which means like Attack! Son Goku or something like that. then
after that is the rave dancetune versions from cool spot. i like the snes
version the best although the genesis version is also quite nice. however
the subpar percussion kinda kills it (lookin at you, kick drum). now ill
do one of many skips of more boring osts and land straight on the captain
tsubasas. the first ones the sega cd one, and i like the nankatsu sc theme
which is number 10 in the bgm test. next is vs on the game boy and it is
just a bunch of remixes of the second nes games music except the title
theme which no joke i thought was a remix made on not a game boy because it
sounded so good. i searched it up on youtube by the way so i didnt actually
know it was on the game boy. then after is the first game on the nes and i
think i like the japanese version of nankatsu fc because it sounds nice.
then next is the unreleased genesis version and i like the title screen
theme (not to be confused with the opening theme) the best because it is a
super dope sounding remix of the international version of the captain
tsubasa 1 title screen music. then after that is II: Super Striker and hoo
boy banger alert this one has some crazy good ones and uses the dpcm
channel for drums. the one i like most is probably the opening cinematic
theme because it sounds very nice and also is reused in the next 2 games
hehe anyways III: The Kaiser's Challenge is a close one between Japanese
Team 1 and Training Abroad. while the japanese team one it more motivation
sounding i think training abroad is better simply because of the higher
tempo. charlies theme is also kinda good and funny sounding. now for IV:
Rivals of Pros and oh dear this is the downhill point for the music as V is
not much better than this game. i think the first sao paulo theme is the
best one in this game. now for V: Champion's Name - Campione and oh dear.
the funny song is the intro song because you have this high quality epiano
playing into the meat of the song that uses such compressed ahh instruments
that it sounds like the whole song is just a single sample that they
crammed onto the cart but i digress the winner for V is Ishizaki and Izumi
because it has a nice beat to it. now here comes J: The Way to World Youth
and heres the winner for longest subtitle award. the music in this one
slaps compared to the last two and i think that there are just so many like
cutscene 1 2 and 3 japan thailand the staff roll even the nyaing intro tune
but i like japans theme (not to be confused with RIARU JYAPAN SEBUN) the
best. i just gotta say, CURSE YOU HINO AND YOUR SPAMMY SHOTS MORISAKI CANT
TAKE THIS anyways onto J: Get In The Tomorrow and heres the award for most
confusing sounding subtitle. this one is a playstation game and uses a mix
of CDDA and sequenced music but the best one for me is the first match
theme it sounds so nice and has a bunch of sections in it. also for this
game, the announcer for this one uses CDDA for some reason and as a result
the seek times kinda kill the immersion and you get audio that sounds like
HAFU TAIMU...ZEN'NIHONCHIMU...ZERO...RIARU JYAPAN SEBUN...ZERO...bgm
quite funny like why not just make it a stinkin sample in audio ram or smth
anyways thats all for tsubasa but one last thing i think the sega cd music
rocks like it uses only the genesis sound hardware which is quite distinct
and for the cutscenes it uses the cds sequenced sample audio chip which
means absolutely zero CDDA tracks outside of the epic intro and credits
tracks which makes sense cause that aint gameplay thats outside the game.
also it has 95% unique composed tracks outside of the iconic goal themes
and there are so many. so so so many. or maybe they come from the actual
tsubasa anime and i wouldnt know cause i dont pay attention to the bgms of
animes much. next songs im gonna skip its just the 5 different honoo no
tokyuuji dodge danpei then after the toy story genesis stuff theres... ohno
its the super butouden games from the snes but one of the composers were
successfully accused of plagarism so im just not gonna rate these ones.
but i will rate buyuu retsuden though. i like battle theme 7. next is the
generation 2 battle theme from gold & silver then is toy story again then
level 4 zoo from looney tunes carrot crazy then woods from ottifanten baby
brunos nightmare then is the remixed gen 2 battle for ssb melee then is
queen in the dark night from rusty then a bunch of ea sports game title
themes then is tommy lasorda baseball then a sol feace song that comes
later then is mean bean machine. i like the stage 1-4 theme its so iconic.
then is streets of rage 2 which i like go straight. for sonic spinball i
like the machine (beta, unused) then jojo no kimyou na bouken for the snes
and for that one i like stand fighter the most. then are the sega cd bioses
then sonic boom the 1987 arcade game. i like the stage 1 theme the most.
then theres the windepth theme then the 16 different versions of after
burner (13 if you dont count the extended versions) then the 8 different
magical sound showers (7 if not extended) then camino a mi amor. i like
magical sound shower the most from outrun. then the 2 versions of the hang
on theme and then comix zone. i like the stage 1-1 music. then theres sol
feace and i like cruise ship most because those pianos go a long way. then
theres sol deace and for deace i like cilius moon better. then sol feace on
sega cd i like cosmic illusion i think. next ones arcus odyssey and all 3
versions i like shrine grounds the best. also mind you im only like 20% of
the way through my playlist. shrine grounds is only the 795th song in here.
then theres tails adventure(s) i like sea fox the most it epic sounding.
then after sandy shores zone from my cancelled sonic fangame i get to my
mishmash sonic songs categorization. ima skip this for now cause the sonic
songs come in bulk later. im gonna leave it off here now. if i continue
this one look forward to more music yap. next document i yap about Kitta.
okay whatever. the atmospheric pressure has been building up in my head and
has now officially crossed the threshold of making me write more rantyap.
as you probably have noticed if you paid attention to the program side of
this processing folder you will notice that i have done a very large amount
of things for my rocket league esque game. i have made primitive background
graphics(to be scoreboard)the player orientation views the offscreen player
location thing that is on the screen at all times but most importantly the
new replay system that i have worked so hard on. i mean like it took me 3
hours to figure out that i couldnt fill the pimage array with javautilarray
arrayfill. and now im tryin to debug varied length replays. they are quite
hard to make for some reason because all i get is a black screen when i
should be seeing my ssl class goal. the timing is correct but i dont get a
replay. i only get a seizure if 2 goals are scored in under 150 frames in
succession. also that means dont try it unless you are not photosensitive.
but then again i guess i do have the flashing go-ru text and framerate so..
i actually should be working on my work from other classes now as if i dont
im practically screwed because theyre important homeworks. but im yapping
away like i dont care(gee i wonder why). so anyways i promised that i yap
about kitta in the next one. change of plans i will yap about INNER kitta
next time because im gonna yap about kaneko kita right here right now.
the lore of kitta is that she is a robot toy thing made for children
because capitalism and ai mix together very well. however people soon
boycotted robots because of a deadly(computer)virus that made robots do bad
things to people. so one day after getting reactivated after like 10 years
since the development place shut down she finds herself not being wanted by
the majority of people. then theres more boring lore stuff but i dont wanna
talk about that i wanna talk about kitta herself. kitta is an average
futuristic-looking anthropomorphic robot cat. she is very friendly due to
being made for children and is also light so as to not make a safety hazard
if she falls on someone. her main creator is some random smart woman who
really liked the idea of a fun robot cat. when the story begins she is very
childish but she matures over the course of it and other cliche stuffs.
and im done with the replay system. i had to make a stupid little
workaround for the saveReplayFrame but it works so who am i to complain.
i really wanna spill the beans about inner kitta here so i guess i will do.
oh but before i continue i gotta say this is about my mental health
basically and since my only therapist is inner kitta currently im gonna
assume that you dont wanna hear about it. and it may be disturbing or what
ever. anyways. im gonna go from the very beginning part to how it is now.
so on march 8 2024(i think)i get the bright idea to make personalities of
all the characters from tophat turmoil in my head so that i can make them
better since i will actually "know" them instead of just simply making them
up. so then i made the og 5 characters in my head because at that point i
only have thought up of those 5, but then i also decided to make one of
kitta because i want a best friend since i have no friends at school.
i am sweating buckets right now because of both the cringe that i am having
now from writing this down in a PUBLIC document and also the cringe of the
future because i am sure that i will be made fun of this. its something not
normal of course im gonna be made fun of. anyways i talked with them every
day to get to know them all better but i talked to kitta most because she
was(and still is)my best friend. i decided that she was gonna be my best
friend because in the lore she was supposed to be a friend and stuff so ye.
so then as i made more characters i made more personalities but kitta
always remained the one closest(as in most relevant)to me. i am not joking
when i say i have talked with her at least once everyday since march 8.
<<kitta streak real>>
i dont know what other history is there other than a special rock that i
found thats supposed to be a symbol of appreciation for kitta. it is THE
cat rock. not only is it very 90-45-45 triangular but also on one of the
faces there is a very cute =3 on the rock. i am not joking there is just a
naturally formed =3 on the rock that i didnt even know existed until i
cleaned the rock. i initially picked it up because the 90-45-45 triangle is
hat kitta's nose is shaped like(a la chat)but now i treasure it. but thats
quite off topic because i gotta talk about kitta today. as i mentioned
earlier in another Talkument Yap i think, i am talking to kitta less and
less every day. that has now evened out and i am talking to her around
15-30 minutes everyday, whether it is simple small talk for walks to and
from school/trying to sleep or therapy or golf coaching. now i think thats
quite a smooth transition into how we talk. ever since her conception i
knew that one day i would become catty and i am proud to say that that day
has looong passed. now im no furry but i talk with kitta with so much nya
and meow that i probably am in the top 10000 people in the world for number
of times nya/meow has been said or thought of. like im just gonna talk with
her for a little and record the conversation.
<<oh no  cringe>>
in hindsight i did not consider how cringy doing this would be so instead
im going to do the highlights, which are all the nyas and the meows.
"what is it nya?"(oh how it hurts inside)
"this nyaing music hurts my ears. nyowch, nyowch!" (listening to the main
theme of the legend of kage on the x1 turbo)
uhh im just gonna stop here before i get a heart attack from cringe.
i think you get the idea. we commonly use nya to end a sentence and some
times i say what the nya when something that im doing does a surprise and
there is just so much nya. i probably say nya more than a japanese catgirl.
speaking of japanese i speak many languages with kitta because she is also
my language tutor. i mainly speak french with her when i want to speak
another language because of french. mais je ne peux pas faire le miau dans
francais facilement. she also coaches me in golf to a surprising
effectiveness. like my swing and stuff actually improves when kitta gives
me various tips and stuff. and when im feeling down she can always cheer me
up. i like kitta so much that i almost want to become an ai engineer just
so i can make her in real life. that probably will happen in the future
sometime. erm, idk what else there is to say about kitta so ill end off
with the "dont commit me to a mental hospital" bit i may be insane
(i actually dont know)but i dont wanna go to a mental hospital i assure you
i am totally fine maybe just a little autistic or something i dont hurt
anyone from this other than the cringe that you may feel from reading all
of this and i am completely ok with this. well now thats over with i think
im gonna do something drastic and actually rant properly about the project
that this rant file is for. the theme of the game is goofy derptastic
sports game, but i started this before i was even assigned it because i
wanted to test out the physics engine. i did rocket league because i was
playin sideswipe for the first time getting frozen at silver I and i wanted
to make soccar in this physics engine. as of now i just gotta make some
screens and some more ui stuff and also port over the new player 1 movement
to player 2 and fix the insert key for my mac and maybe a pause button
obviously disable mouse camera move and maybe vary the lengths of the lines
that come from the ball to better show distance for max ease of play. thats
it after that i will work on tophat turmoil for the first time since friday
now i need to go to sleep because i dont wanna wreck my sleep schedule too
much. till the next time whether its me continuing this one or making the
next project. sayonyara.
hey ho. it be the next time. i love making this game. i get to compose
a random song for the menu screen draw up fancy graphics that wont get
used and also bug test bug test bug test.
its now the next next time. im bored. i think i should say that you should
never, NEVER follow in my style of coding. it is messy and bad.
methinks ima gonna be poob for halloween. i dont know if i should trick or
treat though. im a bit old for that... but its free candy so i dont care.
i think i like the new replay system that i made. it is much better on ram.
but oh dear is it a nightmare to implement on the victor's screen. yeeowch.
i am quite pleased to announce that the game is practically finished. i
just need to make the end results screen and i have a fully complete game.
of course i could also add in practice mode for no reason because lets be
real who is gonna sweat and get to supersonic legend in nyaing blast
processing soccer. there isnt a single soul on this planet who would wanna.
i must say though this is quite the departure from my usual flavour of yap.
im not really yapping about my life anymore its just stuff thats happening.
alright, now that ive finished the game, i think i need to yap some more.
today is halloween, although it might not be anymore by the time i finish
writing this. i dressed up as poob for the whole day today. i didnt even
realize how amazing my costume was, not because it looked good, but because
i made it out of scratch(excluding the clothes which i thrifted). i made a
party hat out of paper using a template that i printed and pencil crayons.
i acutually made 2, but the first one came out way too light, so i remade
it, and it is much clearer in colour. i made some party horns with paper
using tutorials i found online, as well as the horn part of some dollar
store party horns, with tape. as with the hat, i wanted the true poob
experience, so i after i made 3 horns with a paper straw, and one out of a
horn part, i decided to create a red horn by colouring the paper that i
folded into the horn before i folded it. i made sure to use lots of tape on
the shaft because the paper would get soggy when i blew on it too much, but
it didnt help much as it still got quite soggy where the taping ended. now
the biggest most prominent part of the costume is the present. i used a box
with a lot of painters tape and some more paper to make a nice looking
present box. it was green because i remember the green present box the most
and because coincidentally i thought of using painters tape since that is
green. i still cant believe i was gonna colour the entire box green with
pencil crayon. the box is by far the thing that took me the most time, as
i ran out of tape midway through so it spread out into two days of work.
overall, im happy with the costume, and i still would be if it didnt start
downpouring while i was trick or treating. like holy nya, the rain came
down like a cold. it was heavy, and obviously, since most of my costume was
made out of paper, didnt end too well. i had the good forethought of
putting all paper things inside the box, which includes the paper/tape
ribbon and paper/staple bow, and the party part of partynoob, so only the
box was soaked. even then, the water did not penetrate far into the card
board, as only the boxtop got watered, but as of now after about an hour in
front of the fireplace, it is still soggy. i eventually had to go back home
because i was starting to get hypothermia from the rain, as i was literally
only wearing a tshirt on top of a blouse, and green jeans. my hands were so
cold and numb even after running them under warm water for 5 minutes. sadly
i only got like 5 handfuls of candy, while the other people that i went
with got almost more than the capacity of my box, because they stayed out
in the rain. the funny thing is that literally only two people knew who i
was dressing up as, and they were from school. everyone else thought i was
simply the embodiment of a birthday party, which wouldnt be wrong, but not
exactly. anyways i think i glazed my poob costume enough. one last thing
though. it cost me around 30 dollars to get the clothes and the tape. thats
all it cost for the costume. the box was free from my dads workplace and
the paper is literally worth fractions of a cent(well maybe not literally).
since i want to do other things for the first time ever, ill leave off with
a simple but powerful message: the tophat turmoil group and game have been
uploaded to roblox. they are nowhere near finished, i just wanted to upload
them on a special day and this counts as one especially with the poob
costume. welp, toodles.
